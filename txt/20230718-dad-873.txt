Dear Hien Hanh Huy.
I  have  just come back from the gym and read your email
Right   Now, i am very very  very sad
All in my mind is Dad wellbeing  but nothing else
I understand Dad who has very kind heart but  he has been taking 
advantage by a lot of people, women, his relatives â€¦.
I regret the he did not take care of himself

All we need to do now is not to let those things damage his life anymore 
and keep the value of  his financial assets for the rest of hos life

All i am thinking now is just leave everything the way it is
All we need to do is his well being . We respect him as long as he lives
Dad is a decent person we should respect all of his decisions and leave 
his money and his property as long as he lives
I pray that if his mental status improves he will be back to the Dad 
that we had before as much as possible
If he can get out of nursing home, we will find a decent assisting 
living hime for him
When  i lost my CADL i found Stoneridge  assisting living which somebdy 
compare it as a five star hotel
The most important thing we need to do is to keep others from taking 
advantage of his hard earned money, until his death
Anything left after his death will for his  children
I can  even help with the money i have
I do not know how long I live, can be one day , can be 50 more years , 
but i am willing to help financially. i have very little expense for 
daily life. It is very painful to see him at the hose in Huntinton Beach
I do now know how long he can live
If his living condition changes he can live longer as a decent person.
Love,
Mom
