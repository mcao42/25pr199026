Good morning, Maria. The handyman can come today to see about fixing the 
front door and the moisture damage. When he can setup a time, I'll call 
you to see if you'd be home. We can also seal the kitchen sink at the 
same time. The moisture fix will be ASAP (hopefully within one week). As 
for the rental situation, here's what my mother now proposes: (1) Your 
current $3000 would end at the end of August, with no remodeling 
performed. So, nothing changes till after Aug 31st. (2) After August, 
also no remodeling (adding of walls, new tenant, etc. -- that work will 
be postponed to June 1, 2025). (3) However, after August, my mother will 
increase the rent to keep up with the market. If you and she agree on 
terms, then you'd sign another lease effective 9/1/2024 through 5/31/2025.
