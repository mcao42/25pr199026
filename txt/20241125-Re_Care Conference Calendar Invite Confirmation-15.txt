    Sorry I was late.  I don’t have my laptop with me.  It took a little
    bit of time with the slow Wi-Fi to download Microsoft Teams to connect.

    Deyanira…thanks for arranging this much needed meeting to begin to
    surface some major issues. I hope to take part in the next meeting
    in person.
