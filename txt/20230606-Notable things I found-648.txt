So I've been going through a lot of his old boxes.  Probably 50% of what 
he has stored.  Nothing too surprising yet, except the following.

* He was assaulted by a tenant in mid-2022.

* He has issued many 30-day notices to past tenants.  But AFAIK, Ken is 
the first court case for eviction.

* He had a new rental property around 2016-17, but he sold it.

* He seemed to have a gambling habit.  Rough timeline seems to be 
2013-2017, or longer.  I saw he had a book about blackjack.  Also, he 
was in a day trading program for at least a couple of years.
