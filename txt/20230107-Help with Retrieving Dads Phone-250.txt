Mom,

Do you think you can ask Cam Tu and her husband can go get Dad’s phone 
this morning?

HERE THE INFO:

WHERE:  The Apple Find My APP pinpoints Dad’s phone below (see “HC” in 
the grey circle).  It’s on PHILLIPS AVE off BBROOKHURST (between major 
streets Ellis and Talbert) in Fountain Valley.  Also across the street 
from a TJ Maxx.  It is likely in the white dumpster (see 2nd photo below).

SOUND SIGNAL:  If they call Hien (give them his number) when they get 
there, he can make Dad’s phone make a sound.  It still has some battery 
power left as of right now.

ACCESS:  I don’t see a lock on the dumpster but they may want to bring a 
small ladder or step stool.

Dad lost a bag so it maybe in a bag with his stuff.

Forward this email if helpful.

Hanh
