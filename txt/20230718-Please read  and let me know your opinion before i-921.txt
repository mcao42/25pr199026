Dear Hien Hanh Huy.
i read your email and really very confused to the point that my brain 
doesnâ€™t function
I really feel very bad about Dad and feel
  Very helpless about it
I understand Dad who has very kind heart and tremendous   mental problem
All i am thinking now is just leave everything the way it is
All we need to do is his well being
Dad is a decent person we should respect all of his decisions and leave 
his money and his property as long as he lives
I pray that if his mental status improves he will be back to the Dad 
that we had before as much as possible
If he can get out of nursing home, we will find a decent assisting 
living hime for him
when i almost lost my CADL i found Stoneridge  assisting living which 
somebdy compare it as a five star hotel
The most important thing we need to do is to keep others from taking 
advantage of his hard earned money, until his death
Anything left after his death will for his  children
I can  even help with the money i have
I do not know how long I live, can be one day , can be 50 more years , 
but i am willing to help financially. i have very little expense for 
daily life. It is very painful to see him at the hose in Huntinton Beach
I do now know how long he can live
If his living condition changes he can live longer as a decent person.
Love,
Mom
