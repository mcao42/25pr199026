    We did a video call from Oakmont.  This was not the doctor's
    preference, but I tried to do as much as I could (e.g., take BP and
    glucose readings so the doctor would have more data).

    Zoloft is considered mild compared to a lot of other
    anti-depressants, so I'm hoping it has more advantages than
    disadvantages. Eventually when his cognition gets low enough (where
    he no longer complains about food), he should be switched to a very
    low sugar diet and then hopefully de-prescribed a lot of these meds.

    He ran out of glipizide on Friday, so that contributed to the high
    glucose.

    Yes, his BP was at least some good news.

        Thanks for sharing the report.  Did the doctor visit him or did
        you take Dad to Kaiser?  It seems like there are negative
        side effects for every new medication.  Do you know why his
        glucose level is so high?  From my visits at lunch time, it
        seems like they give Dad a lot of starch in effort to feed him
        soft food.  At least his blood pressure seems better?
