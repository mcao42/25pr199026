After talking with Mom, I got some ideas about the various options.

Option 1. Caretaker option (Dad's relative, most likely).I think this is 
not great because (a) the money is somewhat wasted, and we probably 
don't have much extra control.(b) Dad will still be doing his rental 
business, which will get him into trouble.

Option 2. A voluntary guardianship.There will be many disagreements with 
Dad and the guardian about where to live, money, etc.  He'll see that, 
and won't even agree to this option.

_Option 3. Forced conservatorship._Dad's not going to like this, but I 
doubt there is any other choice.

Assuming option 3: (a) Mom wants to compile info regarding incompetency, 
such as his being taken advantage of.  (b) I think we have other proof 
of his incompetence with his tenants.

Almost certainly, #3 will waste the least time and be most effective.  I 
say we head in that direction, and try to get Dad to like the approach 
as much as possible.  Mom and I are in general agreement about this.
