I started a Word document about plans for/with Dad.  So far, there's 
only a Word doc in it.

The Dad folder (you should have edit access): 
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1320_MycpG9PHsHT2Q3XRuVGRsIADyxSq?usp=sharing 
<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1320_MycpG9PHsHT2Q3XRuVGRsIADyxSq?usp=sharing>

Here's a summary.

* Crosby and Chipper will be sold concurrently.  Apparently, Mom thinks 
Crosby should be sold too (we should double check).

* Dad thinks there's no unpermitted development that would make selling 
hard.

* I suggest doing *no remodeling* and only basic infrastructural fixes 
of both properties.  Then, paint.

* Dad thinks eviction of Ken will be difficult.  I don't think so ...  
He's letting us handle that.

* For buying in San Jose, Dad has in mind buying a ranch-style home that 
Hang and I will help manage.  We will convert it to a triplex, similar 
to what we have at our house.  He loves the idea.

Lastly, he was pretty lucid when we talked last night.  He is upbeat and 
seems better without the surrounding stress.
