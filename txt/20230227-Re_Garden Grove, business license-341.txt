    Hi Mom,

    FYI, I called Garden Grove City and made sure your business-license
    account is now current (paid).

    Unfortunately, they do not have an autopay option.  So, I asked them
    to send bills to Mark Cao in San Jose in the future, not to Chipper
    Lane.  I will make sure the bills will not get ignored.
