Dear Mom,

I have been helping Dad to order his affairs.  Because of that, he 
assigned to me to inherit the Chipper house.  This offended Hien 
specifically, and maybe Hanh too (I don't know).  As for Hanh, she asked 
to be removed as a beneficiary for Dad's assets.  Consequently, currently:

* I will inherit the house and its debt.
* Hien will inherit the remaining assets, which I am guessing is about 
$200,000
* Additionally, Hanh seems to be saying she wants the house sold too.  
If the house is sold, Hien will get about $1,000,000 of cash.

I told both of them from the start that Mom will adjust her inheritances 
to make all of this fair to all children.  Financially.  Maybe neither 
one has talked to you yet?

I am asking you *now,* please remove me as your beneficiary.  And 
please, tell Hien to leave me alone.  He is threatening to sue me.  
Would you please just calm him down by removing me from your inheritance 
plans.  If you have any questions, please let me know.  I am willing to 
answer all questions as long as they are focused.

Thanks,
Huy
