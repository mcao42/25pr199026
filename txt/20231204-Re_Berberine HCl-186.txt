    Berberine is natural, as Metformin is.   It has many similarities to
    Metformin, yet is different in its exact mechanism.  Berberine has
    as good a reputation as Metformin among many people who study
    nutritional science.

    Remember that once you lose mental function, it's very serious
    because it is very hard to reverse it.  To avoid losing mental
    function, it's very important to do as much prevention as you can.
