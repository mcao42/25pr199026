>>                     TEN REAL-LIFE STRATEGIES FOR DEMENTIA CAREGIVING
>>                     As caregivers, we often use intuition to help us
>>                     decide what to do. No one ever gave us lessons on
>>                     how to relate to someone with memory loss.
>>                     Unfortunately, dealing with Alzheimer’s disease
>>                     and other dementias is counter-intuitive; i.e.,
>>                     often the right thing to do is exactly opposite
>>                     that which seems like the right thing to do. Here
>>                     is some practical advice:
>>                     BEING REASONABLE, RATIONAL AND LOGICAL WILL JUST
>>                     GET YOU INTO TROUBLE. When someone is acting in
>>                     ways that don’t make sense, we tend to carefully
>>                     explain the situation, calling on his or her
>>                     sense of appropriateness to get compliance.
>>                     However, the person with dementia doesn’t have a
>>                     “boss” in his brain any longer, so he does not
>>                     respond to our arguments, no matter how logical.
>>                     Straightforward, simple sentences about what is
>>                     going to happen are usually the best.
>>                     PEOPLE WITH DEMENTIA DO NOT NEED TO BE GROUNDED
>>                     IN REALITY. When someone has memory loss, he
>>                     often forgets important things, e.g., that his
>>                     mother is deceased. When we remind him of this
>>                     loss, we remind him about the pain of that loss
>>                     also. When someone wants to go home, reassuring
>>                     him that he is at home often leads to an
>>                     argument. Redirecting and asking someone to tell
>>                     you about the person he has asked about or about
>>                     his home is a better way to calm a person with
>>                     dementia.
>>                     YOU CANNOT BE A PERFECT CAREGIVER. Just as there
>>                     is no such thing as a perfect parent, there is no
>>                     such thing as a perfect caregiver. You have the
>>                     right to the full range of human emotions, and
>>                     sometimes you are going to be impatient or
>>                     frustrated. Learning to forgive your loved one as
>>                     well as yourself is essential in the caregiving
>>                     journey.
>>                     THERAPEUTIC LYING REDUCES STRESS. We tend to be
>>                     meticulously honest with people. However, when
>>                     someone has dementia, honesty can lead to
>>                     distress both for us and the one we are caring
>>                     for. Does it really matter that your loved one
>>                     thinks she is the volunteer at the day care
>>                     center? Is it okay to tell your loved one that
>>                     the two of you are going out to lunch and then
>>                     “coincidentally” stop by the doctor’s office on
>>                     the way home to pick something up as a way to get
>>                     her to the doctor?
>>                     MAKING AGREEMENTS DOESN'T WORK. If you ask your
>>                     loved one to not do something ever again, or to
>>                     remember to do something, it will soon be
>>                     forgotten. For people in early stage dementia,
>>                     leaving notes as reminders can sometimes help,
>>                     but as the disease progresses, this will not
>>                     work. Taking action, rearranging the environment,
>>                     rather than talking and discussing, is usually a
>>                     more successful approach. For example, getting a
>>                     teakettle with an automatic “off” switch is
>>                     better than warning someone of the dangers of
>>                     leaving the stove on.
>>                     DOCTORS AND NURSE PRACTITIONERS OFTEN NEED TO BE
>>                     EDUCATED BY YOU. Telling the doctor or nurse
>>                     practitioner what you see at home is important.
>>                     The provider can’t tell during an examination
>>                     that your loved one has been up all night pacing.
>>                     Sometimes providers, too, need to deal with
>>                     therapeutic lying; e.g., telling the patient that
>>                     an antidepressant is for memory rather than
>>                     depression.
>>                     YOU CAN'T DO IT ALL. IT'S OK TO ACCEPT HELP
>>                     BEFORE YOU GET DESPARATE. When people offer to
>>                     help, the answer should always be “YES.” Have a
>>                     list of things people can do to help you, whether
>>                     it is bringing a meal, picking up a prescription,
>>                     helping trim the roses or staying with your loved
>>                     one while you run an errand. This will reinforce
>>                     offers of help. It is harder to ask for help than
>>                     to accept it when it is offered, so don’t wait
>>                     until you “really need it” to get support.
>>                     IT IS EASY TO BOTH OVERESTIMATE AND UNDERESTIMATE
>>                     WHAT YOU LOVED ONE CAN DO. It is often easier to
>>                     do something for our loved ones than to let them
>>                     do it for themselves. However, if we do it for
>>                     them, they will lose the ability to be
>>                     independent in that skill. On the other hand, if
>>                     we insist individuals do something for themselves
>>                     and they get frustrated, we just make our loved
>>                     one’s agitated and probably haven’t increased
>>                     their abilities to perform tasks. Not only is it
>>                     a constant juggle to find the balance, but be
>>                     aware that the balance may shift from day to day.
>>                     TELL, DON'T ASK. Asking “What would you like for
>>                     dinner?” may have been a perfectly normal
>>                     question at another time. But now we are asking
>>                     our loved one to come up with an answer when he
>>                     or she might not have the words for what they
>>                     want, might not be hungry, and even if they
>>                     answer, might not want the food when it is served
>>                     after all. Saying “We are going to eat now”
>>                     encourages the person to eat and doesn’t put them
>>                     in the dilemma of having failed to respond.
>>                     IT IS PERFECTLY NORMAL TO QUESTION THE DIAGNOSIS
>>                     WHEN SOMEONE HAS MOMENTS OF LUCIDITY. One of the
>>                     hardest things to do is to remember that we are
>>                     responding to a disease, not the person who once
>>                     was. Everyone with dementia has times when they
>>                     make perfect sense and can respond appropriately.
>>                     We often feel like that person has been faking it
>>                     or that we have been exaggerating the problem
>>                     when these moments occur. We are not imagining
>>                     things—they are just having one of those moments,
>>                     to be treasured when they occur.
>>                     GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS:
>>                     1. If there are any concerns about caregiver
>>                     resources, patient safety, process of choosing a
>>                     facility to move to, Medi-cal or VA benefits,

>>                     our Department phone above and they will send a
>>                     message to the social worker.
>>                     2. If agitation is occuring, look atwhat is
>>                     triggeringthe agitation. Work on changing the
>>                     circumstances around the trigger, like how a
>>                     family member responds to the patient. If that
>>                     does not work, contact us. Do NOT rely on
>>                     tranquilizers like lorazepam or Ativan which add
>>                     to confusion and builds up in the body.
