Hi Mom,

I have been looking up how the downstairs bath remodel can be done, to 
replace your wet bar with a shower stall.  The city would consider this 
a major remodeling because (1) it involves bathroom plumbing, and (2) it 
changes walls, so there must be verification that a load-bearing wall is 
not affected.

It's possible to do this without pulling a permit, but there are pros 
and cons.  Summary:  It costs $2,000 more to do it the right way, but 
you'll have fewer headaches.

_Advantages of no permit
_
* Faster and saves money:
   - don't have to hire a designer to draw blueprints (at least $1000)
   - don't have to get a city permit (around $1000)

_Advantages of pulling a permit
_
* The city will check the plans and work to make sure it's done right.

* Adds value to the house.  Your house will have 3 baths, not 2.5 baths.

* No problem with selling the house.
   - Some buyers will walk away from a house with unpermitted additions.
   - Some buyers will try to low-ball you, as if you have just 2.5 baths.
   - Some buyers will try to force you to get a permit before going on 
with the deal.  Getting a permit afterward is more expensive.

* No risk of:
   - city penalty (although it's rare that they discover the remodeling)
