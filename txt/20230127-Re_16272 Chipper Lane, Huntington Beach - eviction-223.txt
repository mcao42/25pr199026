Good evening Mark,

                 Ron reminded me that he spoke with you about efiling.

For this the only thing needed is a credit card number, security code 
and zip.

This will be the quickest way for us to file anything regarding the case.

                    Hi Ron,

                    When you have an idea of around when the notice will
                    be served, would you please let me know?

                    Also, just as an informal rule of thumb, is two
                    weeks about the expected time frame till when the
                    sheriff will force out the tenant? Assuming:

                    * the tenant doesn't comply with the 3-day notice

                    * the tenant does not oppose the court complaint

                    Thanks,

                    Mark

                        - eviction

                        Ron,

                        Here are the facts of assault, as alleged by
                        Annalise Hunt.

                        Annalise is an 80 year old woman who is also a
                        tenant at 16272 Chipper Lane in Huntington
                        Beach.  On 12/25/2022, she was vaginally raped
                        by Ken VanNatta.  Her injuries were not only
                        vaginal, but also included bruises to her
                        shoulder and ribs from an assault.  On that same
                        day, 12/25, she went to Fountain Valley Regional
                        Hospital Emergency Room.  She believes the
                        hospital then filed a police report.

                        On Wednesday, 1/18/2023, Annalise's hand bag was
                        stolen by someone inside the house.  She
                        believes the thief was Ken VanNatta, since he
                        was the only person in the home who could have
                        taken the bag.  She later found the bag dumped
                        in the garage, but missing her phone and wallet.

                        She has reported Mr. VanNatta often being
                        menacing, threatening and crude toward her. 
                        Please note that Mr. VanNatta is openly a porn
                        addict, evident from his social media Web pages:
