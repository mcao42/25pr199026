    The doctor will send out a summary from today’s appointment.  The
    doctor said that dad has mild to moderate dementia.  She suggested
    that we watch the video in the link below (let me know if you’re
    unable to view the video):

    It will provide important context to her assessment and will help us
    understand what will happen in the future as dad’s condition gets worse.

    Definitely no driving.  She did say that it’s normal for patients at
    this stage to have anxiety and depression.  She didn’t see any
    evidence today but it could appear in the future.
