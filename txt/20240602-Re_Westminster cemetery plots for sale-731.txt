I just created the listing, but it won't be live until next week 
(Monday?).  When it is listed, I will let you know.

Initial listing is $22,000 that includes both plots.  I am not sure yet 
what is the right price.  We will adjust it later.

        Mom,

        The info I have is that TheCemeteryExchange.com should have the
        most reasonable listing rate.

            TheCemeteryExchange.com appears to have a relatively low
            commission cost for selling a cemetery plot, with listing
            fees ranging from $71.95 to $329.95. This is a one-time fee,
            and there are no hidden fees or commissions. This makes it a
            more cost-effective option compared to other platforms that
            may charge higher fees or commissions.

        Also, we can list on Facebook Marketplace at the same time.  If
        you are okay with this, I will start listing the Westminster
        Memorial plots.

        Huy
