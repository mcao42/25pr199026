                            ____

                            Here are the facts of assault, as alleged by
                            Annalise Hunt.____

                            ____

                            Annalise is an 80 year old woman who is also
                            a tenant at 16272 Chipper Lane in Huntington
                            Beach.  On 12/25/2022, she was vaginally
                            raped by Ken VanNatta.  Her injuries were
                            not only vaginal, but also included bruises
                            to her shoulder and ribs from an assault. 
                            On that same day, 12/25, she went to
                            Fountain Valley Regional Hospital Emergency
                            Room.  She believes the hospital then filed
                            a police report.____

                            ____

                            On Wednesday, 1/18/2023, Annalise's hand bag
                            was stolen by someone inside the house.  She
                            believes the thief was Ken VanNatta, since
                            he was the only person in the home who could
                            have taken the bag.  She later found the bag
                            dumped in the garage, but missing her phone
                            and wallet.____

                            ____

                            She has reported Mr. VanNatta often being
                            menacing, threatening and crude toward her. 
                            Please note that Mr. VanNatta is openly a
                            porn addict, evident from his social media
