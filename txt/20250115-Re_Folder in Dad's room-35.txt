I'll be going to the postoffice and mailing two "Statement of Error or 
Erasure," so you can use one for the title, and one for the REG 262. 
Having that could increase your chances of getting this accepted by a 
DMV official.

And if you still need me to request a replacement title, let me know.

    Jeff,

    When I filled out the REG 262 over the weekened, I wrote my driver's
    license number instead of Dad's.  Well, I am pretty sure that's not
    correct, so I went to the DMV in Los Gatos today to get advice
    and/or a new REG 262 form. Unfortunately, it got more complicated
    from there.  Just as I suspected, apparently these employees have
    differing interpretations of how to fill out these various forms.

    She said to me:
    (1) The date correction should have been done simply using REG 101
    Statement to Record Ownership, on the back of which is a "Statement
    of Error or Erasure." She gave me a form, but it's just on plain
    paper; so, fortunately it's likely to be downloadable if another
    blank is needed.
    (2) I shouldn't have signed as POA the way I did. Dad, despite his
    dementia, could at least initial the title. And he must do that, she
    said.  She implied that a replacement title does not have to be
    obtained, and that the extra owner's signature (Ho Van Cao) can be
    done on the existing form.

    I think she might be right about #1, but I doubt she is right about
    #2 (although she insisted she is right).  Let me know if you have
    good ideas about how to proceed. Personally, I think best is one of
    the following:

    (A) Use the REG 101 to note the mistake of the date on the title; or,
    (B) Use a REG 227 (Application for Duplicate title) and start from
    scratch.

    I think there is a good shot that (A) will be accepted. But if we
    want to be sure, we do (B).

               Mom tried to take the title transfer material to AAA
        today to file, but they did not accept it since the date had
        been changed (even though initialed).  The DMV site/handbook
        says errors on the title are not accepted, so they gave her REG
        252
        (https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/handbook/vehicle-industry-registration-procedures-manual-2/odometer-mileage-reporting/vehicle-vessel-transfer-and-reassignment-form-reg-262/

        to fill out.  This one is not available online since the
        original is required to be filled out on security paper. We
        filled it out but is requires your signature. She would like to
        mail the form to you today.  She/we can drop it to the post
        office if this makes sense.

             The Statement of Facts (form 256) looks ok.

        Thanks,

        Jeff

            Hanh,

            I left a manila folder on Dad's bed shelf.  It has several
            items in it.

            - Corolla:

            1. In the folder is the car registration and 2025 sticker.

            2. For transfer, in the folder there is the car title and
            REG 256 Statement of Facts. This is being done as a gift,
            with a tax advantage. I recommend you write GIFT in the
            Price of Sale field on the back of the title.

            3. A Bill of Sale is not needed. And there's also another
            transfer related form, but that is a seller-only form, which
            I am doing online today.

            - In the folder is also a business license fee statement Mom
            needs to pay, which is payable by phone. Also, I suggest you
            change the address for future use.

            As for car insurance, as you have added Mom to your
            insurance, I will be taking the Corolla and Accord off the
            Geico policy today.

            Thanks,
            Huy
