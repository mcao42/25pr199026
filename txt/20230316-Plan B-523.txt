Hi Hanh,

Yes, got disconnected on the phone last night.  My tenant was ringing 
the doorbell at the same time, so I got distracted and didn't call back.

The forced mental evals that keep happening with Annalise are called 
5150D's in California.  I think that's a way that the police help to 
prevent courts from getting clogged up with misdemeanor and small crimes 
of the elderly with dementia.  So, please look up 5150D for background.

No matter what we do, Dad won't like it.  So, it's only a matter of 
degree, and the more he trusts us in the long run, the greater his 
compliance.

Here are rough steps I propose:

* Our ideal goal should be to have external parties (whether police or 
social work or doctors) initiate a declaration of incompetence.  If that 
is not possible, another approach is to have good cops and bad cops 
among us, so that he won't be alienated from all of us.

* Research his public records, including court records and police 
records. Maybe he has gotten into enough trouble already to justify a 
declaration of mental incompetence.

* If he hasn't "gotten into trouble", we could submit a tip about his 
driving without license.

* Once he gets in trouble and gets scared, we will be in a better 
position to have him declared incompetent -- even if we're the ones to 
initiate such proceedings.

Let me know what you think ... The clock is ticking on him!
