            Good Evening

            Thank you for your time on the phone and we look forward to
            helping you during this difficult time.

            *Board and Care (B&C)-* is a California state licensed care
            home in a residential community. They are licensed for six
            residents and two caregivers.  You pay one price, and all
            care is included. The homes have at least two caregivers,
            they sleep in the home at night.  If the resident needs
            anything they will get up and help them. However, if your
            loved one needs something at night, every night, he/she will
            need to go to a home with awake night staff. Thus, allowing
            them to get assistance with whatever they need 24/7. The
            average price is $4000 - 5500 for a semi private room (may
            or may not include a bathroom). Private rooms start at $5500
            - $8500.  Again, may or may not include a bathroom.
            Transportation is not included. Typically, there are not
            many activities offered in a B&C.  The advantage is your
            loved one will get more one-on-one care, and the price
            points are much lower. They will do activities around the
            table, walks and a "let's be seated" exercise video in the
            afternoon. Most homes have an activities director that comes
            in the home, and music as well.
            There are very few homes with true awake night staff. Not
            sure if dad will need it or not.

            *3:00 Ivy cottages*- Carmen owner - Has been in business for
            over 30 years. awake night staff, 6500, private room,

            Private room. The best care and great reputation. She has 3
            caregivers in the daytime and 2 at night.

            included it.

            *Mary's Loving Care -* owned by a Chinese family - and the
            mom is one of the caregivers. Small home, but very nice. The
            mom speaks perfect English. She has a private room/ awake
            night staff at this home, which gives the complete care that
            your dad may need. Nice home, just smaller, but great job
            with care. I have placed 3 people in this home, and the
            compliments about Mary are incredible. Her price points are
            great considering night staff and the area. $6000 - 6500,
            depending on the size of the room.
            341 16th Place, Costa Mesa, CA
            They do not have a website.


            All board & cares have a one-time admission fee. The average
            is $1000 for the B&C. You will still pay for medication,
            incontinent supplies if needed and supplemental drinks if
            he/she drinks them. Transportation is not provided in a
            board and care.

            We are a free service. My mother/partner was a nurse and
            Case Manager at Kaiser. We are a family business and have
            been placing loved ones for over 8 years! We have contracts
            with all facilities. We will try to work with budgets and
            geographic locations that work best for all family members.
            We will not suggest a facility or home where we would not
            feel comfortable placing our own loved one.
            Thank you for the opportunity to help you during this
            difficult time.  I am waiting on a few homes to get back to
            me.  I will continue to monitor openings and update you as I
            see great options.   Call me anytime with questions. I look
            forward to meeting you. We can meet tomorrow at 3p at Ivy
            Cottages.
            Have a nice evening.
