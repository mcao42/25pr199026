You personally attacked me when I disagreed with you, just like you 
started to personally attack Ally or Anabelle. Your opinion is your 
opinion, but again, I have to do what's best for dad, regardless of your 
opinion.

I understand you're saying Hang is influencing me. This is your way of 
personally attacking other people when they don't agree with you. 
Regardless of your attack, I have to do what's best for dad.

    no longer a single men
    You bave a family ! I respect that
    I had a lot of problems with  dad’s siblings and i do not want to
    think of them at all
    I do not want  to  cause  the same problem to my children
    The mental injury made my decision, i rather swallow my tremendous
    pain and humiliation  until dying than saying anything to my adult
    chidren
    If i made wrong dicision dad and i will die together with dignify
    To me, money is not important
    I live long enough. I can die tomorrow
    But i do not let anybody kill me graduaaly
    Let you know that the decision to move dad closer to me is MY decision
    I am fully responsible for it

        Hi Mom,

        I plan to check out Blessing Home Assisted Living later this week.

        As for future litigation, Hien and Hanh will do whatever they
        feel is best. I am okay wih whatever they do, and I will not
        take any action now, as you are suggesting, to try to influence
        them. My attitude is summarized by:  que sera sera.  I don't
        feel strongly either way about this issue of inheritance as you
        think I do.

        And thank you for having hopes of rehabbing Dad physically and
        mentally. However, you do not know his past status in detail.
        Prior to his stroke (July 2023), he was much healthier than he
        is now. Even at that time, he was drowning in his HB home in his
        own feces and urine. Even then, he already began to suffer
        severely from his neural degeneration due to his /diabetes/,
        which is the result of eating too much starch, sugar, and *fruits*.

        /I doubt you understand the importance of his diabetes
        management. Anabelle's family is from a medical background, and
        they do understand. This is one of the reasons for the conflicts
        about food between you and them: the fruits you bring cannot
        help him./

        His basic health problem is his diabetes. /I repeat, his basic
        health issue is diabetes. And putting him under the full control
        of someone who cannot understand that, will not rehabilitate him./
        /
        /
        I had to help Dad, starting in October 2022 when I saw how bad
        his living condition was. I really had no choice:  Everybody
        else was saying, "I have my own life!"

        I heavily involved Hanh until May 2023. After several weekends
        of convincing him, I finally had him sign Hanh as his full
        durable POA. Not one day passed after that until she completely
        misread his wishes and would allow him to return to her home
        only under her conditions. Because of that, he decided he made a
        mistake to assign the POA to her. And I also agreed with him,
        that having Hanh as the POA could never work. It never works to
        treat someone else with "My way or the highway."

        Hanh thought I spent too much of my weekends going to HB to help
        him. She often encouraged me not to. But how could I not help a
        parent, when he was drowning in feces and urine? I could not
        just say, "I have my own life!" as some advised me to.

        I was spending so much of my time helping Dad that I needed
        efficiency. After obtaining POA, I:

        * Evicted all his difficult tenants.
        * Completely cleaned out his house.
        * Prepared his home either for sale or new rental.
        * Moved him to San Jose and into a B&C.
        * Tied up all his legal loose ends with loans and court cases.

        I could not have done all that without the POA. And I could not
        have done that with Hanh as POA, because she didn't have a good
        feel for how to work with Dad without upsetting him.

        Does this make it clearer to you about Dad's situation and my
        involvement in it?

        As for what you do with your situation, it does not make any
        sense to me that you think this should be part of a family
        agreement. Dad's decisions were his own; that's normal and it's
        how it should be. I just don't understand why you are involving
        me in your inheritance decisions. They should be exclusively
        your decision, and they are not my business at all. So, please.
        Leave me out of that and just make your own decisions. I want no
        part of your decision. "You have your own life!" :-)

        Best regards,
        Huy
