Thinking about the options. Let's discuss today before we meet with Dad 
to make sure we're on the same page.

I'm for a hybrid with the goal of preserving dad's dignity as much as we 
can.

The ideal:

Use payment of mortgage as leverage for dad to voluntarily say yes to 
the following supports we offer him:

We make decisions re: his finances, housing, health care (threaten 
conservatorship and do it if needed)

Evict tenants
Clean out house, make it liveable
Set up a care taker in HB to support Dad and report to us (he has stated 
this as his preferred option in the past)

3-5 yr: sell house, move dad to assisted care in bay area

Short term: we keep Dad in bay area as long as possible to clear out tenants

H.

    It will be a big fight with dad to do option 3. We will spend more
    money on lawyer fees that what he’s worth. I’m in favor of option
    #1. I don’t think he has long. I don’t want to waste a lot of time &
    effort fighting with him and making him feel worthless.

        After talking with Mom, I got some ideas about the various options.

        Option 1. Caretaker option (Dad's relative, most likely).I think
        this is not great because (a) the money is somewhat wasted, and
        we probably don't have much extra control.(b) Dad will still be
        doing his rental business, which will get him into trouble.

        Option 2. A voluntary guardianship.There will be many
        disagreements with Dad and the guardian about where to live,
        money, etc.  He'll see that, and won't even agree to this option.

        _Option 3. Forced conservatorship._Dad's not going to like this,
        but I doubt there is any other choice.

        Assuming option 3: (a) Mom wants to compile info regarding
        incompetency, such as his being taken advantage of.  (b) I think
        we have other proof of his incompetence with his tenants.

        Almost certainly, #3 will waste the least time and be most
        effective.  I say we head in that direction, and try to get Dad
        to like the approach as much as possible.  Mom and I are in
        general agreement about this.
