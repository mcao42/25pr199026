Mom,

Updates on a few items.

(1) Dad is okay with keeping one of the cars.  So let's plan on keeping 
the Corolla.
(2) I will remove the Camry from AAA insurance.
(3) AAA is okay with renewing insurance, as long as someone else (not 
Dad) is the policy holder.  So we can switch that to either you or me.  
AAA noted that Dad's driver license is invalid.  Therefore they will 
provide insurance only if he is explicitly excluded as a driver.

Shopping around may result in a somehow lower premium, but I believe AAA 
is competitive, and it's best to continue AAA for now.  I will let you 
know when I have a quote from them.

        Hi Mom & Hanh,

        Dad has been paying for insurance from AAA for your (Mom's) car,
        the Honda, but the insurance's last day is September 19th,
        2023.  Mom, please be sure to buy your own insurance before then
        to make sure your car is covered.  If you need our help shopping
        for insurance, please let us know.

        FYI, regarding what's happening with the Camry and Corolla
        ownership.  Those two cars are covered by the same insurance as
        Mom's Honda.  FYI, the insurance cost paid by Dad has been
        $3,700 annually.

        The 2005 Camry (200,000 miles) has a market value of around $2K.

        The 2022 Corolla (7,000 miles) seems to have a market value of
        around $20K.  But probably less, since it has been in accidents
        and, even after the insurance fixes, still has a long gash on
        the passenger side.

        I obtained the replacement pink slips for both cars, and those
        should be arriving in the mail any day now.  Dad said he is fine
        with selling the Camry.  So, I will do so, before the insurance
        expiration (9/19/2023).

        As for the Corolla, I will ask Dad whether he'd like to keep the
        car or sell it.  If he wants to keep his car for family use, I
        think I'll need to pay for insurance, since his paying thousands
        when he cannot drive wouldn't be fair to him.

        Thanks,
        Huy
