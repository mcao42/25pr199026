Hanh,

See below:

Hi Ho and family:
I work in the diabetes office and received a referral to help with your 
diabetes care. The metformin medication is best taken at the very end of 
the meal with food still in the stomach to avoid upset stomach or loose 
stools.
I was reviewing your blood glucose results. It looks like the fasting 
blood glucose are nearly all in target range of 100-140 mg/dl. When you 
check the blood glucose in the evening, is this before dinner, two hours 
after dinner or at bedtime?
The goal for blood glucose:
before dinner or any meal is 100-140 mg/dl.
Two hours after dinner less than 200 mg/dl.
At bedtime 100-200 mg/dl.
Eating the non-starchy vegetables first with meals does help to blunt 
the rise in blood glucose. Aiming for 1/2 the plate to be non-starchy 
vegetables also helps to limit the amount of rice or noodles consumed 
with the meals.
I noticed that his blood pressure was above target back in January. Are 
you checking his blood pressure at home? If so, what have you been 
getting for his results including the pulse?
It's important that we keep his blood pressure and blood glucose in 
range to keep his kidneys healthy.
Please call me when you have time to discuss his diabetes care. My 
direct number is 925-243-2718. You can also e-mail me and let me know a 
good day/time to call you.
Best Regards,
Margie
