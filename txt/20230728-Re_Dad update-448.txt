        April Health Care called me again.  I talked with the person
        from there.  They said that they’re not trying to sell
        anything.  They’re calling about medical equipment that dad
        needs one he leaves.  They’re calling on behalf of Kaiser.  I
        gave that person both of your names & numbers.
