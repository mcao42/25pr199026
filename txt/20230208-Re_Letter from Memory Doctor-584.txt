Hanh,

You’re missing the point.  If you read the instructions from the doctor, 
she said to redirect, redirect, redirect.  You can’t argue with him 
about the driving thing even if he doesn’t have a valid drivers license 
today and doesn’t have a prayer of passing the driving test.  The Uber 
thing is a way to redirect his concern and move him on to something else.

>             Please call the Memory Center in 2 months to schedule a
>             follow up phone call with Mary Cochran Abraham: (925)
>             313-4577. We know it can be overwhelming caring for a
>             loved one with dementia. This call will provide a chance
>             for you to check in with us so that we can assist you with
>             any issues related to Ho Cao’s dementia.
>             If you have moved out of the area, transitioned to
>             hospice, or have made a permanent move into a nursing
>             home, we would appreciate it if a family member could
>             contact us to prevent further outreach.
>             Regarding Department of Motor Vehicle (DMV) reporting;
>             California state law requires me to send a form to the
>             Department of Public Health if there is a concern
>             regarding safety while driving. They notify the Department
>             of Motor Vehicles. I have no choice in this matter.
>             From the DMV: 'Driving is an activity that uses a number
>             of cognitive skills
>             <https://hswprodnbm.appl.kp.org/portal/dmv/?1dmy&urile=wcm:path:/dmv_content_en/dmv/about/senior/health/exercise> in
>             a complex manner. These cognitive skills include memory,
>             visual processing, attention, and the ability to analyze
>             driving-related situations to make appropriate decisions.
>             Medical conditions and medications common to seniors have
>             an impact on cognitive abilities.
>             Your muscle strength, endurance, flexibility, and muscle
>             reaction to stimuli are all necessary for operating your
>             vehicle and for turning your head to view traffic.
>             Age-related physical changes and musculoskeletal diseases
>             (such as arthritis) may affect your ability to drive
>             safely and comfortably.'
>             Please be advised that I, as your Memory Center provider,
>             do NOT have the authority to grant you driving privileges,
>             nor to speed up the review process; only the DMV has that
>             authority.
>             After a report has been filled with the Department of
>             Public Health, they notify the DMV who will send paperwork
>             to you to fill out. The DMV may suspend your license until
>             they have further information about your condition.
>             What to do with the paperwork sent by the DMV to you:
>             --You should complete your portion including your medical
