Here’s his login info.  When you see him in Feb, you will need to help him login to the ones that I didn’t have the passwords for.  When you have it, update the list and share with the rest so that we all have his latest passwords.

We need to write it down and help him remember what it is so that he doesn’t reset it all the time.
