Well, I have no idea why the Accord lacked collision coverage. All other 
cars have collision coverage under the Geico policy, including the 
Corolla.  Note, the Corolla should not be driven until it is transferred 
to Mom's name and put under another insurance policy; I take no 
responsibility for anything that happens with the Corolla under Geico 
coverage, since apparently I don't understand the coverage details.

Since the lack of Accord collision coverage was probably my fault, I 
will pay for the replacement cost of her 2012 Honda Accord.  I will 
lookup the blue book value. We'll need to see if the other insurance 
company will cover this, after the two companies negotiate who was at fault.

Your asking for the other party's insurance info might complicate 
things. It sounds like you want to submit a third-party claim. Normally, 
the two insurance companies figure out who was at fault and who's paying 
for what.  Anyway, I'll forward you whatever info Geico sends to me.

 >How much was "saved" compared to all the costs and suffering she's 
going through now?

You're saying her current suffering is because she was paying a cheap 
vehicle premium?  Start making sense!

Thanks,
Huy

    Mom talked to Geico yesteday. This confirms what Mom said all along
    that it was NOT her fault.

    But there are so many questions this letter raised about the kind of
    decisions and action made on her behalf with full trust to take care
    of her. Why did mom not have collision insurance? How was that
    decision made? Was there an explanation to her last Oct about what
    was set up? What if she had been badly injured? How much was "saved"
    compared to all the costs and suffering she's going through now?

    We will get quotes for more adequate coverage.
