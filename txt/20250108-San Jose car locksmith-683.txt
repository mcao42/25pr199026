Here are the steps I did for programming a car key:

1. (Optional) I bought a key for my car. For you, that would be a key 
like this one, for $50: https://www.ebay.com/itm/353528657193

2. Call the locksmith to make an appointment.  He will not meet you 
without an appointment.  EZ-Locksmith, (408) 613-6000 or (415) 975-1310.
You will let him know you need a key for a 2022 Toyota Corolla. He will 
ask if you already have a key.  If not, probably he has to order one, 
and charge you extra for it.  For just the cost of key programming for 
my car was $120.
Once you have an appointment, he will give you a day, time and the 
address to go to.
