The Chipper house is nearly ready for rental to a family (four bedrooms, 
two baths; Dad will keep two bedrooms, two baths and a kitchenette).  
Ken is out and Jeff is currently being court evicted.  The two biggest 
remaining problems for Dad are:

1. He keeps driving.  In fact, he caused a minor accident just yesterday.

2. Annalise.  Or more precisely, she is easy to get out of the house, 
but Dad has been undecided about her fate.  Therefore she keeps getting 
permitted back in the house.

I think I can convince Annalise to move out in the August timeframe.  By 
September 1st, there should be a new rental lease starting.  Starting in 
September, hopefully Dad will have assisted-living help and can be 
weened off his cars.
