So, just to set an appropriate tone for this message, I don't think Dad 
is close to death.  Stroke survivors do have lowered life expectancy.  
If anything, Dad's stroke is a wake-up call that we need to prep for 
eventualities.

Here are the major items:

* I am doing all the beneficiary stuff now for Dad (i.e., assignment to 
Hien).
    - The only asset I have not looked into is the annuity.

* If you don't lift a finger now, and eventually you need to go to 
probate court, that's on you (and your claim likely won't be 
honored, due to higher-priority claims against the estate).  I am doing 
just about as much work as possible now to save you the trouble, but 
it's possible I am overlooking something.

* I am disinclined to initiate a revision the Living Trust.  Where any 
asset happens to fall to Hanh (which is unintended, given that I already 
relayed Hanh's wishes to Dad, and he was okay with that), I will still 
follow what's in writing and signed.  It will be up to Hanh to transfer 
those assets to Hien after the fact.  And of course, we are all aware 
that Mom will be informed about these things and make adjustments on her 
end.

* The Advance Health Care Directive (2/5/2023) says Hien is the 
primary.  By the way, that was a sloppy job; the dates are variously 
written as 2/5/2022).  Hien really ought to take on that role, whether 
Hien wants to or not.  Hien has known about that signing for months and 
has had a lot of time to tell Dad "No".  Hien, may I point to the part 
of the Directive that states that decisions should be consistent with 
his wishes and values.

Generally, it does not seem to be in good taste to revise Dad's legal 
documents while Dad is in distress.  Dad had an intention about them and 
plenty of time to think about them and revise them, but now he is ill 
and it is time to implement his intention, not to change them. Even if 
we disagree with some details, it should be time to honor his statements.

Other:

* Not sure if I need to mention Jessica Cao, since you both have said 
you don't have any interest in getting involved, but I had to pursue 
that to honor Dad's wishes.  I expect the trial to happen around 
December.  If it succeeds, the creditor will be Hien.  Thereafter, Hien, 
if you don't want to deal with it, just sell the judgment to a collector.

* Dad wants to have a case against Vui ($20K).  Vui is a jerk.  The 
amount is small enough, and there are so many disputes about payments of 
which I have no record, that I don't think I should pursue it.  The 
counter-claim is that Dad owes Vui $2K.
