Dear Huy
You are always my SON. . I raise you and educated you to a man with a 
kind heart
I understand you very much, i still love you for ever, but you are no 
longer a single men
You bave a family ! I respect that
I had a lot of problems with  dadâ€™s siblings and i do not want to think 
of them at all
I do not want  to  cause  the same problem to my children
The mental injury made my decision, i rather swallow my tremendous pain 
and humiliation  until dying than saying anything to my adult chidren
If i made wrong dicision dad and i will die together with dignify
To me, money is not important
I live long enough. I can die tomorrow
But i do not let anybody kill me graduaaly
Let you know that the decision to move dad closer to me is MY decision
I am fully responsible for it

    Hi Mom,

    I plan to check out Blessing Home Assisted Living later this week.

    As for future litigation, Hien and Hanh will do whatever they feel
    is best. I am okay wih whatever they do, and I will not take any
    action now, as you are suggesting, to try to influence them. My
    attitude is summarized by:  que sera sera.  I don't feel strongly
    either way about this issue of inheritance as you think I do.

    And thank you for having hopes of rehabbing Dad physically and
    mentally. However, you do not know his past status in detail. Prior
    to his stroke (July 2023), he was much healthier than he is now.
    Even at that time, he was drowning in his HB home in his own feces
    and urine. Even then, he already began to suffer severely from his
    neural degeneration due to his /diabetes/, which is the result of
    eating too much starch, sugar, and *fruits*.

    /I doubt you understand the importance of his diabetes management.
    Anabelle's family is from a medical background, and they do
    understand. This is one of the reasons for the conflicts about food
    between you and them: the fruits you bring cannot help him./

    His basic health problem is his diabetes. /I repeat, his basic
    health issue is diabetes. And putting him under the full control of
    someone who cannot understand that, will not rehabilitate him./

    I had to help Dad, starting in October 2022 when I saw how bad his
    living condition was. I really had no choice:  Everybody else was
    saying, "I have my own life!"

    I heavily involved Hanh until May 2023. After several weekends of
    convincing him, I finally had him sign Hanh as his full durable POA.
    Not one day passed after that until she completely misread his
    wishes and would allow him to return to her home only under her
    conditions. Because of that, he decided he made a mistake to assign
    the POA to her. And I also agreed with him, that having Hanh as the
    POA could never work. It never works to treat someone else with "My
    way or the highway."

    Hanh thought I spent too much of my weekends going to HB to help
    him. She often encouraged me not to. But how could I not help a
    parent, when he was drowning in feces and urine? I could not just
    say, "I have my own life!" as some advised me to.

    I was spending so much of my time helping Dad that I needed
    efficiency. After obtaining POA, I:

    * Evicted all his difficult tenants.
    * Completely cleaned out his house.
    * Prepared his home either for sale or new rental.
    * Moved him to San Jose and into a B&C.
    * Tied up all his legal loose ends with loans and court cases.

    I could not have done all that without the POA. And I could not have
    done that with Hanh as POA, because she didn't have a good feel for
    how to work with Dad without upsetting him.

    Does this make it clearer to you about Dad's situation and my
    involvement in it?

    As for what you do with your situation, it does not make any sense
    to me that you think this should be part of a family agreement.
    Dad's decisions were his own; that's normal and it's how it should
    be. I just don't understand why you are involving me in your
    inheritance decisions. They should be exclusively your decision, and
    they are not my business at all. So, please. Leave me out of that
    and just make your own decisions. I want no part of your decision.
    "You have your own life!" :-)

    Best regards,
    Huy
