Pick me up at long beach airport and drop me off at the church
Please give me the address of the church

Thatâ€™s Hilton hotel, not Church, next to Hyatt hotel on PCH:
The Warterfront Beach resort, Hilton Hotel

Use the hotel main Entrance.  Tell them you come for a wedding rehearsal 
for Lisa & Gerardo, you may get free valet parking.
Rehearsal will be in the Breakwater Ball Room, On second floor

-The Rehearsal will start at 6:00pm on Friday 4/14.  If we finish early, 
we will wait for you Hai.  You should see all the flowers decorations

Will call you after  Huy picks me up
We will go directly to your house or the rehearshll site, depending on time
