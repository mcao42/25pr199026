Huy,
This is the way the system   worked when i was working for social 
services over 10  years ago
-The social worker on duty of the day takes phone calls of the day and 
makes separate referrals for each case
You do not need to go into details, but you manage to get more immediate 
attention and prompt action    to our case
When the assigned worker call back for more detail you will refer to me 
or hanh
-Emergency referral can go immediately to the supervisor. All referrals 
will be submitted to the supervisor who prioritizes the level of 
urgency and  assigns the case to workers of  the unit
-Assigned worker then contacts with the caller for more details of the 
case.
-He might request to make a home call with nurses, county Physician, 
policeman…for immediate action or interagency referral (mental health , 
financial assistances, housing assistance, fire department,  home 
shelter assistance…)

-You will a be ask for  your name and phone number for more questions
- you can mention about  my name as ex wife, hanh’s name for
More information and send back ground information status

- you should mention  about dad’s social status to get more attention or 
better treatment ,and for  more experienced or better  knowledgeable worker

        _*On Monday:*_

        I'll call Adult Protective Services and tell them my concerns
        about Dad.

        /Immediate concerns:
        /

        * He regularly drives without a valid driver license.
            - Recently he has been in several car accidents.  His car is
        possibly impounded now, following his last accident.

        * Threats and plots against one of the tenants (Ken).
            - Unsubstantiated allegations of rape against that tenant,
        which were part of an eviction attempt that was eventually dropped.

        * Illegal harassment of one of the tenants, for which Adult
        Protective Services was called around 4/6.  The harassment
        included physical assault (grabbing clothes and spitting) and
        removal of the tenant's refrigerator.

        * Health hazards:  House and kitchen are very dirty.  Feces all
        over at least one of the bathrooms.  Bio odor throughout the house.

        * Fire hazards:  blocked access ways.  Some smoke alarms are not
        working.

        * Tenants have not been informed of his mental diagnosis.  Thus
        they are exposed to a danger of which they are unaware.

        /Other concerns:/

        * He is not taking his meds.  He has a diagnosis of dementia and
        diabetes, but often skips his prescription meds.

        * Public indecency.  He walks around with his pants dropped
        below his buttocks.  He has incontinence issues but does not
        wear adult diapers.

        * Many police calls to the house (eight in the last three
        months), some of which are against him for complaints of assault.

        * Two pet cats in the home, possibly inhumane treatment of them.


        *_Long-term desire, for County to assist with:_*

        * Declare incapacitance.
            - All tenants should be informed, and sign an informed
        consent form.

        * Give the family some guidance for how to be granted full
        conservatorship.
