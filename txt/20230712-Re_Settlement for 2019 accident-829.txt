It's probably an attorney scheme that legit doctors don't participate in.

        Karina, the laywer, called today.  Here's what she told me.

        The medical expense is a whopping $165K.  And this is why Dad's
        share will be smaller than expected.  Dad had asked them to
        assure him that he will get a final amount of $60K.  The two
        sides agreed to that.  The $60K will come to Dad as a lump sum.

        Karina says the $250K will come almost immediately from the
        insurance company, but it could take as long as 3.5 months for
        the medical negotiation to be completed.  (If the $60K is
        guaranteed, it's a mystery why they have to wait 3+ months to
        cut a $60K check.)

        Karina says 2 months for the final $60K is more realistic.  I
        asked her, given Dad's current condition, shouldn't we (Dad)
        sign a beneficiary letter to avoid going to probate for the
        $60K.  Karina says drafting a beneficiary letter is not worth
        the trouble.  She didn't spell out what she meant, but I believe
        what she means that if Dad dies before the medical expenses are
        reduced, the law firm will simply cut a $60K pronto to Dad's
        name.  Then the beneficiary of one of his bank accounts would
        deposit the check before presenting the bank with the death
        certificate to empty all funds.

            Hien,

            Dad signed the "Release of All Claims" today.  Some details
            of what Dad will get.

            * 250K (gross)
            - minus 45% lawyer's fee on the gross
            - minus court related costs
            - minus medical expenses

            I recommended to Dad a structured settlement (annuity)
            rather than a lump sum.  Dad will be designating you as the
            sole beneficiary as soon as that is allowed, so that you
            wouldn't have to go to probate court.
