Huy,

As we are not expecting Ken to pay rent after the Notice to quit, time 
is of the essence to get the house ready for sale.  The mortgage 
payments will dismiss Dad’s savings considerably.

Can you provide a status update and how you’re keeping on top of the 
legal firm to avoid further errors and delays?

H.

    Hi Dad,

    To summarize, here is the eviction process, which could take two
    months to complete.

    1. 3-day Notice to Quit.  Starts today, Monday, 1/23.

    2. End of 3-day period will be Thursday, 1/26.

    3. On Friday, 1/27, Legal Service Centers (hired by us) will file
    landlord's "Unlawful Detainer" complaint against Ken.  From that
    day, he has five days to respond.

    4. Around 2/6, assuming no response from Ken, Legal Service Centers
    will file a Default on your behalf.

    5. The Court processing of that Default could take 3 - 6 weeks.

    6. Approximately in March, the Court will be able to close the
    case.  Only by then will the County Sheriff be called to physically
    force out the tenant.

    7. After the tenant has been forced out, only after that can you
    withhold services from him.  The most important service is that he
    will be unable to enter the house, as you will change the locks at
    that time.
