    Good evening Mark,

                     Ron reminded me that he spoke with you about efiling.

    For this the only thing needed is a credit card number, security
    code and zip.

    This will be the quickest way for us to file anything regarding the
    case.

                        Hi Ron,

                        When you have an idea of around when the notice
                        will be served, would you please let me know?

                        Also, just as an informal rule of thumb, is two
                        weeks about the expected time frame till when
                        the sheriff will force out the tenant? Assuming:

                        * the tenant doesn't comply with the 3-day notice

                        * the tenant does not oppose the court complaint

                        Thanks,

                        Mark

                            *Subject:* 16272 Chipper Lane, Huntington
                            Beach - eviction

                            Ron,

                            Here are the facts of assault, as alleged by
                            Annalise Hunt.

                            Annalise is an 80 year old woman who is also
                            a tenant at 16272 Chipper Lane in Huntington
                            Beach.  On 12/25/2022, she was vaginally
                            raped by Ken VanNatta.  Her injuries were
                            not only vaginal, but also included bruises
                            to her shoulder and ribs from an assault. 
                            On that same day, 12/25, she went to
                            Fountain Valley Regional Hospital Emergency
                            Room.  She believes the hospital then filed
                            a police report.

                            On Wednesday, 1/18/2023, Annalise's hand bag
                            was stolen by someone inside the house.  She
                            believes the thief was Ken VanNatta, since
                            he was the only person in the home who could
                            have taken the bag.  She later found the bag
                            dumped in the garage, but missing her phone
                            and wallet.

                            She has reported Mr. VanNatta often being
                            menacing, threatening and crude toward her. 
                            Please note that Mr. VanNatta is openly a
                            porn addict, evident from his social media
                            Web pages:
