Dear Hien and Hanh,

Just to update you on a few things.

* Dad's case with Adult Protective Services was closed a couple of weeks 
ago, by way of referral to OC Mental Health.

* Dad's case with OC Mental Health started to be resolved yesterday, 
toward eventual closure.  The officer was satisfied that the POA signed 
by Dad sufficed to mitigate any immediate need for a public guardian to 
serve as a conservator.  I am going to put the POA under the Dad share 
folder for your records.

Due to the POA, I would rather have had all of us, jointly or 
separately, help in his decisions.  But he was more savvy than me, most 
likely from remembering the advice of his lawyers in Anaheim.  He said 
that too many cooks spoil the broth.  To be honest, given our track 
record, I don't completely disagree with him.  I want to do things 
efficiently, including selling his home and relocating him.  These 
things have been consuming a great deal of time.  If you have opinions 
on those matters, I prefer you go through me first.  This is a strong 
preference, to make sure we do not create unnecessary confusion for Dad.

Thanks,
Huy
