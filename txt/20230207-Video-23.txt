The doctor will send out a summary from today’s appointment.  The doctor 
said that dad has mild to moderate dementia.  She suggested that we 
watch the video in the link below (let me know if you’re unable to view 
the video):

It will provide important context to her assessment and will help us 
understand what will happen in the future as dad’s condition gets worse.

Definitely no driving.  She did say that it’s normal for patients at 
this stage to have anxiety and depression.  She didn’t see any evidence 
today but it could appear in the future.
