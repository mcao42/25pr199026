        Hanh, Good plan! Thank you for having hanh for having very
        noce friends, and good arrangement for the day!
        Sure i will have  a good time w Frank and Ed
        It will be a pleasant surprise foe Dad to show him a lot  of
        pictures of the trip
        Thr time i visited DC , over 50 years ago, the Grant’s was over
        70 . The house is probably transfered  to several other owners,
        even though they have children
        I still have tons of letter we wrote at the time,  in my garage
        But i asked Huy to test dad’s memory
        He is very good with numbers! He learned English by dictionary!
        When he was in High school

            Mom,

            I spoke to Frank.  He said he and Ed will be by
            tomorrow around *10a to pick you up*.

              Here is the plan:  he will drive you to Embassy Row in
            Georgetown. Lunch at a favorite French place called:  Chez
            Billy Sud.  Take a boat trip at 1:30p to the wharf, then
            head to the botanical gardens and come back to Georgetown. 
            You should be back to the Airbnb by dinner time.  I will be
            back from my group dinner around 8p.

            If all goes well, Ed will join. If not, only Frank.  I think
            you'll have a lovely time with them.

              * You should have Frank's cell number from my text, but
                it's:  (703) 725-8837.
              * He has the airbnb address which is:  146 Thomas St., NW
                Washington DC.


            Have fun!  I wished I could join you but will on Friday,
            -- 
            Hanh
