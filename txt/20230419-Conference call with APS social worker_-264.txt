Hien and Hanh,

I spoke again to Michelle Nguyen, the Adult Protective Services social 
worker.  She reiterated that she wanted to do a conference call with all 
of us.

1. I am guessing that Thursday would be the best day to book something.  
My schedule is flexible, so I just need to know what would work for both 
of you.

And when talking to her:

2. We should offer her documentation, as it seems her investigative 
scope is limited.

3. IMO, we should let her know our intention of suing for 
conservatorship.  This then should put her in a mode of thinking of (a) 
supporting it, (2) giving helpful tips (perhaps even attorney names), 
and (3) sharing her experience of when a conservatorship makes the most 
sense.

Thanks,
Huy
