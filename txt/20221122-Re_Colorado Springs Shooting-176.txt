I just checked with Sammy and she has "marked safe" herself and her 
friends and family! Thanks for checking up

    Hi Huy,

    Very tragic what happened in CO springs.  I was thinking of Sammie. 
    Did she move back there?  I hope she wasnâ€™t affected by this through
    people she knows.  Undoubtedly, community will feel fear and grief
    for a long time.
