the vibe I got from him today is that he trusts you more to do the POA.

Remember, he used to have a very suspicious mind, before it 
deteriorated.  Somewhere in the back of his mind now, I think he 
suspects that I am behind all his recent problems, but he can't piece it 
together!

    Thanks.

    We're in a good position to get Dad to sign the Durable POA. I'm
    fine if he gives you the POA, especially since you're doing the TRO/RO.

    Make clear that if he tries to revoke this, Kim/Michele will
    immediately step in.

    Don't waste your whole day.

    Dad know you're coming?

        Hi Hanh,

        How about this.  I go to SoCal with two possible POA forms for
        him to sign.  In order of preference:

        1. Durable POA.  (More powerful than a general POA.)

        2. Limited POA.  In this one, we list specific powers, like
        selling property.  We try to list as many things as possible so
        that it is almost like a General POA.

        What do you think?  This is something that only he has to sign. 
        So, you won't need to do any prep work.  The legal gist of it is
        very similar to the Advance Healthcare Directive, so you could
        look at that again to jog your memory.
