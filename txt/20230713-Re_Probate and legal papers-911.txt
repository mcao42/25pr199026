Re Vui, his daughter seems to have good written records, and claims they 
owe only around $5K.

    So, just to set an appropriate tone for this message, I don't think
    Dad is close to death.  Stroke survivors do have lowered life
    expectancy.  If anything, Dad's stroke is a wake-up call that we
    need to prep for eventualities.

    Here are the major items:

    * I am doing all the beneficiary stuff now for Dad (i.e., assignment
    to Hien).
        - The only asset I have not looked into is the annuity.

    * If you don't lift a finger now, and eventually you need to go to
    probate court, that's on you (and your claim likely won't be
    honored, due to higher-priority claims against the estate).  I am
    doing just about as much work as possible now to save you the
    trouble, but it's possible I am overlooking something.

    * I am disinclined to initiate a revision the Living Trust.  Where
    any asset happens to fall to Hanh (which is unintended, given that I
    already relayed Hanh's wishes to Dad, and he was okay with that), I
    will still follow what's in writing and signed.  It will be up to
    Hanh to transfer those assets to Hien after the fact.  And of
    course, we are all aware that Mom will be informed about these
    things and make adjustments on her end.

    * The Advance Health Care Directive (2/5/2023) says Hien is the
    primary.  By the way, that was a sloppy job; the dates are variously
    written as 2/5/2022).  Hien really ought to take on that role,
    whether Hien wants to or not.  Hien has known about that signing for
    months and has had a lot of time to tell Dad "No".  Hien, may I
    point to the part of the Directive that states that decisions should
    be consistent with his wishes and values.

    Generally, it does not seem to be in good taste to revise Dad's
    legal documents while Dad is in distress.  Dad had an intention
    about them and plenty of time to think about them and revise them,
    but now he is ill and it is time to implement his intention, not to
    change them. Even if we disagree with some details, it should be
    time to honor his statements.

    Other:

    * Not sure if I need to mention Jessica Cao, since you both have
    said you don't have any interest in getting involved, but I had to
    pursue that to honor Dad's wishes.  I expect the trial to happen
    around December.  If it succeeds, the creditor will be Hien. 
    Thereafter, Hien, if you don't want to deal with it, just sell the
    judgment to a collector.

    * Dad wants to have a case against Vui ($20K).  Vui is a jerk.  The
    amount is small enough, and there are so many disputes about
    payments of which I have no record, that I don't think I should
    pursue it.  The counter-claim is that Dad owes Vui $2K.

    thanks,
    Huy
