Good afternoon Michelle,

We were wondering if another meeting with you tomorrow (Wednesday), 
anytime 1-2 or 3-4:30, for a duration of 15 to 30 minutes, is possible?

As we processed the information exchanged last week, some questions came 
up.  We know for sure we will contact a lawyer very soon (most likely 
this week).  Perhaps we should let the attorney orchestrate legal 
matters (RO and eviction) rather than to do so ourselves right away.

In particular with respect to RO's potentially to be filed on behalf of 
our father against his friend (Annalise) and his tenant (Ken), I am not 
sure if those actions will advance the conservatorship.  So, your 
additional input about issues of guardianship could help us with some 
planning.

Best regards,
Mark
