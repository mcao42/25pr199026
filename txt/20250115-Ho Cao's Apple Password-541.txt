I'm trying to set up one of my old iPad for mom to use because she has 
trouble reading the emails on her iPhone.  The one that I'm trying to 
set up was set up with dad's apple ID.  It looks like you've changed 
dad's apple password.

Can you either provide me with his new apple password or go into icloud 
and delete the ipad from his devices so that I can complete the set up 
for mom?

Please reply to let me know that it's done.
