            I spoke again to Michelle Nguyen, the Adult Protective
            Services social worker.  She reiterated that she wanted to
            do a conference call with all of us.

            1. I am guessing that Thursday would be the best day to book
            something.  My schedule is flexible, so I just need to know
            what would work for both of you.

            And when talking to her:

            2. We should offer her documentation, as it seems
            her investigative scope is limited.

            3. IMO, we should let her know our intention of suing for
            conservatorship.  This then should put her in a mode of
            thinking of (a) supporting it, (2) giving helpful tips
            (perhaps even attorney names), and (3) sharing her
            experience of when a conservatorship makes the most sense.

            Thanks,
            Huy
