I activated a different iPad under his account. It's a newer one that 
allows me to do more things remotely in case he has issues.

    Please note, I had to change Dad's Apple-ID password.  I've noted
    the change in the passwords spreadsheet.

    He said his old iPad "broke" and asked me to take him to Costco to
    get a new one (a cheap 64 GB model).  While setting it up, I noticed
    the old password (???????1023t) did not work, so I changed it to
    ???????1023! .

    Seems he had not been able to read his Yahoo emails in recent weeks
    (months?).  I have made sure he can read emails on hvc_bus@yahoo.com
    <mailto:hvc_bus@yahoo.com> on his phone.  And tomorrow, I will make
    sure he can read hvc_bus@yahoo.com <mailto:hvc_bus@yahoo.com> emails
    on his new tablet.

    While setting up the new iPad based on the old iPad's backed-up
    settings, the latest backup of the old iPad was stated as January
    24, 2023.  That didn't seem consistent with his statement that "the
    old iPad recently broke."

    Two other things.

    Although we now have power to sell his house, in my humble opinion,
    we need to be very careful how we talk to him about it.  I did not
    tell him "Your house will be sold," but rather, I told him "Maybe
    it's time to think about selling your house."

    In preparing to sell his house, today I threw away about 30 pounds
    of old junk mail.  (I had to do it while he wasn't looking; he wants
    to keep even junk mail, even though he will not miss them).

    On Sunday, again in prep to sell his home, I will organize his paper
    files, books, etc.  The idea is to do subtle organizing that grunts
    can't do.  After the sensitive stuff is handled such as to avoid
    losing documents, we can then hire grunts to store furniture, fix
    the house, etc.

    Thanks,
    Huy
