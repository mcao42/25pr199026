The following is what I know about.

Taxes - she asked me to do them for her this year (TY 2022).

Garden Grove City business license for renting - I've changed the 
address from Chipper to my San Jose address, so I can tell her about 
renewals.

AAA car insurance - she will get her own insurance after September 2023.

As for anything else, one of us should go through all her files and make 
sure all mailing addresses are no longer Crosby or Chipper.

    Mom is still tied to dad for a lot of things like car insurance,
    AAA, taxes, etc. We should figure out what all the links are and
    help her sever those links/dependencies. The day is coming when she
    needs to have her own solution to all those items.

            Hi Mark, your Dad seems to be exhibiting signs of
            Alzheimer's. Some days he seems okay, but other days he's
            really out of it! That's my observation. Also he brought
            back that woman, Annalise, who your Dad told police several
            weeks ago that she has Dementia. And both last night and
            tonight she left a burner on, on the kitchen stove after she
            had gone to bed. I discovered that when I went into the
            kitchen around 10PM tonight and about the same time last
            night. She never cleans anything and leaves all the pots and
            pans and dishes dirty. Your Dad used to keep everything
            clean and also clean the kitchen table after he ate, but he
            no longer does that. Elise everything a mess, which he did
            not used to do! Question: Do you have Power of Attorney over
            your Dad? He appears as if he is becoming incompetent and
            Analise's dementia and forgetfulness is becoming a danger to
            the safety of everyone
              here as well as to this property! The shrubs and weeds on
            the side of the house are all overgrown. I would trim it
            myself but your dad has no tools to do that. So again do you
            have power of attorney? Thanks! Ken Van Natta
