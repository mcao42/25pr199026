        Hanh
        Please stop giving  me free  advices
        As long as mine brain still functions, i know what i am doing to
        keep my active and independent life
        Any of your advice about cleaning my house keeps  me awake all
        night , because i can not do more than what  i am doing so far
        I always try hard to keep myself from saying something that hurt
        others and a i want others to treat me the same
        That is why i keep living by myself
        Please respect me as much as others
