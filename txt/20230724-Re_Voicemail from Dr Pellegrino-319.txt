Do you know how is Dr. Pelligrino is transferring care to Dad's primary 
doctor? Have you had contact?

Based on Dad's outbursts, it sounds like he needs psychiatric support. 
That's what happened last time.

    Hi Mark, this is Dr. Pellegrino calling. You don't need to call me
    back. Unless you didn't get the information you need from my phone
    call. Just briefly as you know, I decided he could make his own
    decisions when it's obvious. I'm willing to do that and it seemed
    very obvious on the day I saw him. So. Number two. I'm not sure if
    he's eating enough. A lot of patients like this who are borderline.
    We send them home hoping that they'll eat better at a more home
    environment. They perceive as home. So I'm hoping he continues to
    eat better in a couple of weeks. I'm going to want his primary
    doctor to check blood test. So please make sure that gets done just
    to make sure he's not getting dehydrated. I literally think of the
    one in ten chance. He's going to be dehydrated every now and then if
    somebody like this doesn't eat. Well we have to admit them to the
    hospital ...
    I'm hoping they'll be okay. I did blood tests here and they're kind
    of fine. He's got some mild chronic kidney disease. So it's hard to
    tell based on his blood test if he's hydrated well or not but he
    seems to be doing okay. So that's about it. I made some adjustments
    to his medicine. So call me if you have any further questions, or if
    there's anything unclear 714-734-5500. Thanks a lot, bye-bye now.
