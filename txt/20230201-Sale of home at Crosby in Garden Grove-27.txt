Dear Thanh (mother) and Maria,

Thanh would like to meet you, Maria, on Thursday, February 16th or 
Friday (2/17) to discuss a possible sale of the property at Crosby Ave.

Since I have been in the middle of communications, I am passing along 
everything I know, so that you won't have to repeat info.

    Maria Jaimes, (714) 650-1462
    Celia Serrato, (714) 609-8562.  Celia is Maria's daughter.
    Thanh Huynh, (510) 728-1557 (home) or (510) 881-3251 (cell)
    Mark Cao, (714) 699-4447.  Mark is Thanh's son.


Maria has asked for a couple of considerations:

First, one of the teens is currently attending high school and is in his 
second year.  Maria wishes for him to finish the school year, and even 
to finish all of high school if possible.  I responded to Maria that 
Thanh does wish to sell the house later this year, probably by mid-2023.

Second, Maria then left a voicemail on Saturday, 1/28, asking the following:

 1. Maria likes the home and location.
 2. Would Thanh consider selling the house to Maria?
 3. If a private sale is possible, then how to determine the price and
    the sale process?

I replied to Maria that Thanh is open to the possibility, so long as the 
sale is still at market value, but possibly with some discount to Maria 
for both sides paying less commissions to real-estate agents.

Thanh will be in OC from February 15th to 18th, with the 16th and 17th 
being the best days to meet with Maria.  By talking face to face, it 
will be a good way of:

1. Seeing if a sale is possible (e.g., loan qualification).
2. Seeing if an agreement on principle is possible (e.g., how to set a 
price, how to save on commission costs, what type of sale, and perhaps 
which agents to employ).
3. Discussing when a transaction might take place.

Maria, please let me know what date and time works for you for a 
meeting.  Then, Thanh will take it from there.

Sincerely,
Mark
