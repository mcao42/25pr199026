Thanks for sharing the report.  Did the doctor visit him or did you take 
Dad to Kaiser?  It seems like there are negative side effects for every 
new medication.  Do you know why his glucose level is so high?  From my 
visits at lunch time, it seems like they give Dad a lot of starch in 
effort to feed him soft food.  At least his blood pressure seems better?
