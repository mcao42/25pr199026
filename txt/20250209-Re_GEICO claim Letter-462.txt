Hanh Yu> But there are so many questions this letter raised about the 
kind of decisions and action made on her behalf with full trust to take 
care of her. Why did mom not have collision insurance? How was that 
decision made? Was there an explanation to her last Oct about what was 
set up? What if she had been badly injured? How much was "saved" 
compared to all the costs and suffering she's going through now?

This chapter closes with the $8,800 bank check that I will send to Ms. 
Huynh to her address later this month by a tracked FedEx envelope. I 
will let you know when to expect its arrival.

Attached is the estimate, using the same estimator (NADA) used by most 
car companies. It's easy to miss the attachment.  But it is attached.

Sincerely,
Mark Cao

    Mom talked to Geico yesteday. This confirms what Mom said all along
    that it was NOT her fault.
