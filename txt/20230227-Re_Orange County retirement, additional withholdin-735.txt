Yes, it's okay to call OC after you're back in town.

        Hi Mom,

        Please be sure to call Orange County and let them know you want
        to withhold an additional amount from your retirement paychecks.
        Last year, you had $3,500 withheld in Federal taxes, but you
        need more like $7,500 (in total federal taxes) withheld.
