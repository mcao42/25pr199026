Hanh,

I spoke to both D and Maylin of Redwood Hospice today. Some of what I 
heard made my jaw drop to the floor.  After speaking to them, I've 
finalized my decision that it would be best for the efficiency of Dad's 
care if family members go through me to express their opinions about 
their needs and/or Dad's needs.  This goes for the B&C as well. It seems 
they are constantly receiving advice about food and dentures in a manner 
that is not actionable by them.

Thank you for understanding.
