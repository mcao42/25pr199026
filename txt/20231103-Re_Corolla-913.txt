Hi Mom,

I just spoke to the Dublin officer (925-557-6255).  Here's what he said 
to me.

The man whose car got damaged lives in Dublin.  The dent on his car is 
not big, but it's noticeable.  He said he found a note on his car with a 
description of your car and license plate.

The officer said to him it doesn't make sense that a car from Hayward 
got in an accident with his car.  The man agreed, and mentioned that he 
was in Hayward a couple of days ago.  I guess that must be when the 
incident happened.

So, the officer wants to come back to your house to inspect your car as 
part of his investigation.

He says you're not in trouble (e.g., no hit and run).  Rather, they just 
want to know exactly what happened.

        Okay, then I will drive the Corolla to you, most likely next
        weekend, November 11th, if you are around. I think it's not a
        steep learning curve. You mainly just have to get used to the
        feel of a new car.

            features for older driver and less powerful tha the honda
            But i have to learn how to use it

                Hi Mom,

                What do you think about trading the Corolla for your
                Honda?  You keep the Corolla and we will keep your car
                for driving to/from Orange County.  Then we will trade
                back, after you no longer want to drive anymore.

                The Corolla has some pretty good safety features, like a
                rear-view camera for when you are backing up the car.
