I'm putting a priority on:

* making sure all of Dad's liquid assets are beneficiary-designated
* transferring all checking/savings cash to BofA
* transferring brokerage assets to BofA, *if* the broker does not allow 
me to designate beneficiaries using the POA
    - the same goes for money-market accounts

The following don't need to be transferred right away to BofA:

* brokerage accounts and money-market accounts that do allow a POA to 
designate the beneficiaries

The POA assignment definitely allows all financial transactions (hence 
my ability to transfer any assets to BofA).  The gray area is whether 
beneficiaries can be changed by the POA appointee, with different banks 
having different rules.
