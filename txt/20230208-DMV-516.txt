Hanh - I remembered what you asked me to help with - the DMV response. 
  Below is the excerpt regarding the DMV in Dr. Datta’s message.  It 
predicated on the assumption that dad has a valid drivers license.  I 
don’t think he does.  If he truly doesn’t, I’m not sure that there’s a 
lot of do in response.

Regarding Department of Motor Vehicle (DMV) reporting;
California state law requires me to send a form to the Department of 
Public Health if there is a concern regarding safety while driving. They 
notify the Department of Motor Vehicles. I have no choice in this matter.
 From the DMV: 'Driving is an activity that uses a number of cognitive 
skills 
<https://hswprodnbm.appl.kp.org/portal/dmv/?1dmy&urile=wcm:path:/dmv_content_en/dmv/about/senior/health/exercise> in 
a complex manner. These cognitive skills include memory, visual 
processing, attention, and the ability to analyze driving-related 
situations to make appropriate decisions. Medical conditions and 
medications common to seniors have an impact on cognitive abilities.
Your muscle strength, endurance, flexibility, and muscle reaction to 
stimuli are all necessary for operating your vehicle and for turning 
your head to view traffic. Age-related physical changes and 
musculoskeletal diseases (such as arthritis) may affect your ability to 
drive safely and comfortably.'
Please be advised that I, as your Memory Center provider, do NOT have 
the authority to grant you driving privileges, nor to speed up the 
review process; only the DMV has that authority.
After a report has been filled with the Department of Public Health, 
they notify the DMV who will send paperwork to you to fill out. The DMV 
may suspend your license until they have further information about your 
condition.
What to do with the paperwork sent by the DMV to you:
--You should complete your portion including your medical record number, 
sign in the appropriate places on the first page, and do one of the 
following:
--emailto DSAROMI@kp.org <mailto:DSAROMI@kp.org> (recommended)
