Amber just called me about the same query of the attached PDF.  She was 
very friendly and cheerful (different from the formal letter's tone).

* She said Geico was contacted by the other side's lawyer.
* The lawyer disclosed that the client is going to a chiropractor for 
injuries.
* The lawyer wants to know the Geico limits for compensation.  That is $50K.
* That information ($50K) has not yet been disclosed to the lawyer. They 
need your permission first before they can do so.
* The extent of injuries and damage award is not known until the therapy 
sessions have finished. But she told me (obviously informally) that $50K 
should cover that kind of therapy.
* Referring to the letter, it looks like I am the one who should sign 
the letter. So, I need to know how you want to proceed.

In my limited experience, the other side would like to know the limit so 
they can ask for that amount and no more. You should research to make 
your own decision.
