                                alleged by Annalise Hunt.____

                                ____

                                Annalise is an 80 year old woman who is
                                also a tenant at 16272 Chipper Lane in
                                Huntington Beach.  On 12/25/2022, she
                                was vaginally raped by Ken VanNatta. 
                                Her injuries were not only vaginal, but
                                also included bruises to her shoulder
                                and ribs from an assault.  On that same
                                day, 12/25, she went to Fountain Valley
                                Regional Hospital Emergency Room.  She
                                believes the hospital then filed a
                                police report.____

                                ____

                                On Wednesday, 1/18/2023, Annalise's hand
                                bag was stolen by someone inside the
                                house.  She believes the thief was Ken
                                VanNatta, since he was the only person
                                in the home who could have taken the
                                bag.  She later found the bag dumped in
                                the garage, but missing her phone and
                                wallet.____

                                being menacing, threatening and crude
                                toward her.  Please note that Mr.
                                VanNatta is openly a porn addict,
