Hi Mom & Hanh,

Dad has been paying for insurance from AAA for your (Mom's) car, the 
Honda, but the insurance's last day is September 19th, 2023.  Mom, 
please be sure to buy your own insurance before then to make sure your 
car is covered.  If you need our help shopping for insurance, please let 
us know.

FYI, regarding what's happening with the Camry and Corolla ownership.  
Those two cars are covered by the same insurance as Mom's Honda.  FYI, 
the insurance cost paid by Dad has been $3,700 annually.

The 2005 Camry (200,000 miles) has a market value of around $2K.

The 2022 Corolla (7,000 miles) seems to have a market value of around 
$20K.  But probably less, since it has been in accidents and, even after 
the insurance fixes, still has a long gash on the passenger side.

I obtained the replacement pink slips for both cars, and those should be 
arriving in the mail any day now.  Dad said he is fine with selling the 
Camry.  So, I will do so, before the insurance expiration (9/19/2023).

As for the Corolla, I will ask Dad whether he'd like to keep the car or 
sell it.  If he wants to keep his car for family use, I think I'll need 
to pay for insurance, since his paying thousands when he cannot drive 
wouldn't be fair to him.

Thanks,
Huy
