Hi Huy,
I hope everything will turn out the ways your dad wants.
A few things come in mind if your dad wants to give it away now….
  If any real property is gifted,
(1) gift tax needs to be filed even though no gift tax is paid
(2) the basis of the property is the same as the original owner’s basis 
(higher taxes because no step up in basis when the giver passes away)
(3) property tax will be reassessed at the current market value.
To minimize taxes, both capital gain and property taxes, additional 
planning and alternatives need to be explored.
