Mom has nothing to do with this. Leave her alone.

This is about your greed and manipulating dad for your own selfish gains.

Dad has serious health conditions and needed care that he was getting at 
Hanh’s house in order to avoid serious issues like a stroke.

You used Annalise to gain his trust. You used the OC social worker to 
get power of attorney from him. Since then, you e done all you can to 
prevent any insight from my part into dad's financial situation so that 
you can manipulate his finances without questions from those who truly 
care about his well being.

His stroke is a consequence of your selfish actions. You have to live 
with that for the rest of your life. Everyone knows what you did and why 
you did it no matter how many emails you send out. It’s your cross to bear.

What I do for mom or dad is done out of love & care. I never ask for 
anything in return or want anything in return.

Dad will need the money from the sale of his house in order to pay for 
the care that he will need to recover from the situation that you’ve 
created.

Huy - do the right thing. It’s never too late to do better.

Do better.

    Dear Mom,

    I have been helping Dad to order his affairs.  Because of that, he
    assigned to me to inherit the Chipper house.  This offended Hien
    specifically, and maybe Hanh too (I don't know).  As for Hanh, she
    asked to be removed as a beneficiary for Dad's assets. 
    Consequently, currently:

    * I will inherit the house and its debt.
    * Hien will inherit the remaining assets, which I am guessing is
    about $200,000
    * Additionally, Hanh seems to be saying she wants the house sold
    too.  If the house is sold, Hien will get about $1,000,000 of cash.

    I told both of them from the start that Mom will adjust her
    inheritances to make all of this fair to all children. 
    Financially.  Maybe neither one has talked to you yet?

    I am asking you *now,* please remove me as your beneficiary.  And
    please, tell Hien to leave me alone.  He is threatening to sue me. 
    Would you please just calm him down by removing me from your
    inheritance plans.  If you have any questions, please let me know. 
    I am willing to answer all questions as long as they are focused.

    Thanks,
    Huy
