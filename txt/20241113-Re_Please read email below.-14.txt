Deyanira,

Aplogies. I didn't see a message from you on Nov 8.  I have been out of 
the country since Nov 7 and will return on Nov 22.

Would it be possible for us to arrange a time to meet when I am back. I 
am available on Wed, November 26, between 11a-5p PDT by phone or zoom. I 
would  like to meet with you. I am looping key family members, my 
brother, Huy Cao, and my mother, Thanh Huynh, who have been in frequent 
contact with my father, to invite them to this meeting.

Thank you,

Hanh

    Greetings, Hanh.____

    __ __

    I hope this email finds you well. My name is Deyanira Lopez, but I
    go by D. I am one of the MSW from Redwood Hospice. I tried to reach
    out to you via. text message on Friday (11/08) and unsure if you
    received it. I am reaching out to you to ask if you were open to
    attending a care conference to discuss any questions or concerns you
    may have at this time. The attendees of the care conference meeting
    would be the Redwood hospice cares team, facility staff, and family.
    If you are interested in attending, do you mind sharing your
    availability for this week. Ideally, we are still trying to
    coordinate the meeting for this Thursday (11/14) in the morning or
    late afternoon. If that doesn't work, this Friday or Saturday
    morning or late afternoon would work as well. Please let me know if
    you have any questions or need clarification. Thank you for your
    time. ____
