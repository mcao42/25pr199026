    Hi Mom & Hanh,

    Dad has been paying for insurance from AAA for your (Mom's) car, the
    Honda, but the insurance's last day is September 19th, 2023.  Mom,
    please be sure to buy your own insurance before then to make sure
    your car is covered.  If you need our help shopping for insurance,
    please let us know.

    FYI, regarding what's happening with the Camry and Corolla
    ownership.  Those two cars are covered by the same insurance as
    Mom's Honda.  FYI, the insurance cost paid by Dad has been $3,700
    annually.

    The 2005 Camry (200,000 miles) has a market value of around $2K.

    The 2022 Corolla (7,000 miles) seems to have a market value of
    around $20K.  But probably less, since it has been in accidents and,
    even after the insurance fixes, still has a long gash on the
    passenger side.

    I obtained the replacement pink slips for both cars, and those
    should be arriving in the mail any day now.  Dad said he is fine
    with selling the Camry.  So, I will do so, before the insurance
    expiration (9/19/2023).

    As for the Corolla, I will ask Dad whether he'd like to keep the car
    or sell it.  If he wants to keep his car for family use, I think
    I'll need to pay for insurance, since his paying thousands when he
    cannot drive wouldn't be fair to him.

    Thanks,
    Huy
