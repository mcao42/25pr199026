I don’t keep track of what I do for mom or dad. I wanted my phone back 
so that when I upgrade my phone, I can keep my current one and turn that 
one in for a credit towards my upgrade.

You don’t need to send any money.

I do t need any more emails from you regarding this topic.

    Here's what I suggest.  Dad does separate accounting than me.  If
    you want to pay me, you pay me.  If Dad owes you something, Dad will
    pay you.  Dad and I are not merged at the hip.

        I have no idea how to calculate for the solar work.  You work
        something out if you want to pay that.

            Subtract it against what I owe you for the solar work. I
            don’t need a check.

                        provided this cell phone to him.
