Deyanira,

I am not able to participate in person. Can you send a zoom link? I do 
not have phone access but have access to wifi.

Please let me know: (1) who requested this meeting, (2) purpose of 
meeting, and (3) agenda. What are we going to accomplish with this meeting?

Thank you,

Hanh
