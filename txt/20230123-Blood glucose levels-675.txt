Here are some of the guidelines I used in interpreting my own glucose 
readings.

1. The more informative readings are two hours after finishing a meal; 
refer to the 2nd-to-last column below.  If Dad is making progress and 
becoming increasingly insulin sensitive, his reading should get under 200.

Glucose Level Reference 			
(mg/dL) 	After fasting 	1-2 hrs aft meal 	2 hrs aft meal 	2-3 hrs aft meal
Normal 	70-99 	< 140 	< 139 	< 100
Prediabetes 	100-125 		140-199 	
Type 1/2 Diabetes 	> 126 		> 200 	


2. Individual readings can be off as much as +- 10.  So, the trend after 
several days is what matters.  For this reason, the readings should be 
logged in Excel.

3. Compare "like" readings to each other, not with "differing" 
readings.  E.g., compare morning readings to morning readings, and 
2-hours-after-meal readings to each other.

4. Be careful about morning readings, due to the "dawn phenomenon" in 
which blood glucose is naturally high due to circadian rhythm, getting 
the body ready for the day.
