Yes, I'm willing to chip in!  As for intel, yes, let me ask Annalise and 
get back to you. :-)

I love the idea of a hearing aid, but "listening loss" seems more likely 
to be caused by his cognitive decline, not the other way around.  There 
is a book coming out next month, called Brain Energy, which I'd like to 
get you a copy of for Christmas.  Really interesting stuff.

    If dad needs it and will wear it, I’m more than happy to contribute
    even if it’s for the more expensive prescription one.  Chris’ mom
    wore it.  You have to replace the small batteries weekly.  Because
    they’re small, they’re also easy to lose.
