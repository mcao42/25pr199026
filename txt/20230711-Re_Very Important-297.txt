Understood, perhaps later then.

I never said anything about her outfoxing me.  We (Leo, Hang and I) have 
a detailed plan for how to persuade her to move out, to be implemented 
as early as the end of July.  I didn't want to make this attempt 
seriously so soon, but Dad has been playing with fire and he's sure to 
get burned.

She has been there for over a year.  She paid him $2,500 several months 
ago, then another $3,000 just a couple of days ago.  He thinks he is 
outsmarting her.  However, she is trying to marry him, which will really 
complicate things.  He went from laughing off the idea to now taking it 
seriously.

She is pretty odd.  She married the same man twice (Thomas Paalman) and 
claims she never married anyone else.  But she keeps referring to him as 
her "first husband," but then saying it's a joke.  She also has used 
completely different names in the past, Connie Feutz (maybe her maiden 
name) and Connie Paalman.

I don't care how lonely Dad is, this nonsense needs to be stopped.

    Huy,

    It sounds like Dad is struggling to get rid of the boomerang lady,
    and she's continuing to manipulate and outfox everyone.

    As both she and Dad left a nasty message on my voicemail a few
    months ago, I don't feel comfortable visiting while she's around. 
    I'll skip the July visit.

        I told Dad about your decision. His feelings did not appear to
        be not hurt. Until I get the paperwork changed, in the
        unfortunate event that he would pass away beforehand, please
        just send any cash you get from Dad's inheritance directly and
        completely to Hien.

        Hien will be the beneficiary of the injury settlement and all
        the other liquid assets.

        Regarding your last sentence, I agree with you in theory. But in
        practice, this is the same approach suggested by the
        investigator, which dad has explicitly rejected. There are many
        large risks of losing Independence completely and especially of
        being in the care of total strangers.

        The situation with the greedy Annalise is reaching a crisis
        point. It looks like she's out-foxing dad.

                Thank you. Yes, I already took you off as primary
                trustee. You are now the first contingent trustee. Per
                your wishes, I will let dad know and take you off as any
                kind of beneficiary.

                If you are unwilling to serve any kind of role in the
                healthcare directive, that also would be good to know.

                It's not good to involve the neighbors in this. As I
                hinted before, at least one of the neighbors is a bigot.
                Dad asked one of his neighbors to be a witness for these
                signings, so revisions is not something I want to do
                regularly.

                    I'd like to be taken off the list as Dad's

                    you've taken on that role, Huy because of the power
                    of attorney.

                    I don't want to speak for Hien. He can let you know
                    himself, his preference.

                    All I meant to say was I prefer for you to be the
                    beneficiary since you've been doing all of the work
                    to take care of Dad.

                        After months of preparation of Dad's docs and
                        finances, in which I kept you in the loop, Hanh
                        texted to me several days ago.  It must have
                        taken Hanh several seconds to do this.  She
                        texted her preference to have Hanh and Hien be
                        removed as any kind of beneficiary for Dad's
                        assets (I can provide a screenshot if that is
                        needed).

                        As I stated before, any kind of decision like
                        this is fine with me.  It's equitable.  Mom will
                        be subtracting from or outright removing anybody
                        favored by Dad to assure equity.  And this is
                        fine with me to have Mom opposing what I am
                        doing for my parent.  I absolutely cannot do the
                        right thing for my aging parent if Mom imposes
                        her conditions on how I help my parent.

                        Please, know that it takes significant
                        resources, the most valuable of which is time,
                        to do these things.  But it seems worthwhile to
                        do Dad's documents once to get it right.  If you
                        are unwilling to be:

                        * his trustee (someone he can rely on)
                        * his beneficiary

                        then please let me know now so I can help redo
                        his documents, just one more time.

                        There is a lot of urgency to these tasks because
                        of (1) his age and (2) things like his $250K
                        settlement for which his lawyer does not seem to
                        be in any hurry to close.  Therefore beneficiary
                        assignments are needed.

                        Thanks,
