Actually this was just a telemarketing call.  When I called back, they 
tried to sell some sort of medical alert device to me.

        Thanks Hien.  They need to get everything set up at the Board &
        Care for Dad's discharge on Thursday.

        What do they need, authorization? Proper set up is important.
        Dad is essential incapacitated. He has to be transported in a
        gurney. He cannot sit up in wheelchair.

        I'm traveling tomorrow afternoon. Maybe better if they try Huy
        first.  Can you provide name and phone number to call back?

            I got a voicemail from Apria Health Care about some
            equipment that was ordered. I donâ€™t know anything about it.
            It thought that they will either call you or Huy about
            medical stuff.
