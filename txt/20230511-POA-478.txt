Hi Hanh,

How about this.  I go to SoCal with two possible POA forms for him to 
sign.  In order of preference:

1. Durable POA.  (More powerful than a general POA.)

2. Limited POA.  In this one, we list specific powers, like selling 
property.  We try to list as many things as possible so that it is 
almost like a General POA.

What do you think?  This is something that only he has to sign.  So, you 
won't need to do any prep work.  The legal gist of it is very similar to 
the Advance Healthcare Directive, so you could look at that again to jog 
your memory.
