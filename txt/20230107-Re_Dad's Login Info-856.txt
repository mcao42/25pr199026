    Here’s his login info.  When you see him in Feb, you will need to
    help him login to the ones that I didn’t have the passwords for. 
    When you have it, update the list and share with the rest so that we
    all have his latest passwords.

    We need to write it down and help him remember what it is so that he
    doesn’t reset it all the time.
