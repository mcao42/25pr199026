    Ron,____

    Here are the facts of assault, as alleged by Annalise Hunt.____

    __ __

    Annalise is an 80 year old woman who is also a tenant at 16272
    Chipper Lane in Huntington Beach.  On 12/25/2022, she was vaginally
    raped by Ken VanNatta.  Her injuries were not only vaginal, but also
    included bruises to her shoulder and ribs from an assault.  On that
    same day, 12/25, she went to Fountain Valley Regional Hospital
    Emergency Room.  She believes the hospital then filed a police
    report.____

    __ __

    On Wednesday, 1/18/2023, Annalise's hand bag was stolen by someone
    inside the house.  She believes the thief was Ken VanNatta, since he
    was the only person in the home who could have taken the bag.  She
    later found the bag dumped in the garage, but missing her phone and
    wallet.____

    __ __

    She has reported Mr. VanNatta often being menacing, threatening and
    crude toward her.  Please note that Mr. VanNatta is openly a porn
    addict, evident from his social media Web pages:
