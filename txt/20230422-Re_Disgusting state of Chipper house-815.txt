    Ugh!!

    I don't know why the tenants stick around. They must be desperate
    for housing.

    H.

        I was in the Chipper house today for about 10 minutes, but
        couldn't stand being in there.  Dad invited me to eat, and I
        said no thanks.

        There appear to be small insects (fruit flies?) hovering over
        the trash.  The floors look like they have not been mopped in a
        decade.  On the tables and counters, things pile up, so there is
        not a normal empty area for eating.  Hallways and walkways are
        lined with boxes and furniture, making walking around hard to do.

        You have to be there to believe it.  If you view pictures, it
        actually does not look bad.

        The absolutely worst thing is the strong bio odor.  It gets
        worse and stronger with each visit.  The smell is unique to his
        house, so honestly I don't know what it is exactly, but Michelle
        seemed to think there's a feces component to it.

        I had to drive Dad's car earlier today, so I sat where he
        usually sits.  The smell (feces?) stuck to me for about an hour.
