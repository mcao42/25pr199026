Yes ... first of all, Mom overpaid for insurance, so essentially she is 
paying for the Corolla insurance. And secondly, dad intended to give the 
car to mom for the extra safety features

    Thanks Huy.  I didn't know that Mom was interested in driving
    another car?

        Also, I should mention that there is no remaining service
        contract for the Corolla.  Dad bought a two-year contract that
        has already expired.

            Hi Hanh,

            We dropped off the Corolla at Mom's house for her use as
            long as she wants/needs it.  Mainly, it has a rear camera
            that's a great safety feature.

            Here are a few other details so that we together can help
            Mom to use and maintain this car.

            * Navigation:  It does not have a built-in mapping system. 
            Mom simply needs to plug in her iPhone to the lightning
            cable in the car, then use the phone's Maps program.  It
            takes about 15 seconds after plugging in the phone for it to
            "connect" to the car, which seems long to me, but otherwise
            it's easy and completely automatic.

            * Maintenance.  The odometer is currently at 8,600 miles and
            just got an oil change using high quality synthetic oil. 
            So, it should not need much maintenance at all till the
            odometer reads 28,000 miles.  I think I can help mom with
            other maintenance as needed, such as tire pressure and air
            filter.

            Huy
