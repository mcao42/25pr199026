Hi Mark, this is Dr. Pellegrino calling. You don't need to call me back. 
Unless you didn't get the information you need from my phone call. Just 
briefly as you know, I decided he could make his own decisions when it's 
obvious. I'm willing to do that and it seemed very obvious on the day I 
saw him. So. Number two. I'm not sure if he's eating enough. A lot of 
patients like this who are borderline. We send them home hoping that 
they'll eat better at a more home environment. They perceive as home. So 
I'm hoping he continues to eat better in a couple of weeks. I'm going to 
want his primary doctor to check blood test. So please make sure that 
gets done just to make sure he's not getting dehydrated. I literally 
think of the one in ten chance. He's going to be dehydrated every now 
and then if somebody like this doesn't eat. Well we have to admit them 
to the hospital ...
I'm hoping they'll be okay. I did blood tests here and they're kind of 
fine. He's got some mild chronic kidney disease. So it's hard to tell 
based on his blood test if he's hydrated well or not but he seems to be 
doing okay. So that's about it. I made some adjustments to his medicine. 
So call me if you have any further questions, or if there's anything 
unclear 714-734-5500. Thanks a lot, bye-bye now.
