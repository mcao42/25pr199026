Here are my notes from the conference call with Michelle.  Feel free to 
add or amend.

I created a folder in the shared Dad google drive folder called 
"Conservatorship":

    I suggest we compile and combine our notes before coming back to
    Michelle with questions. We'll email that communication to Michelle
    so that we will all be included, and we make need to make very good,
    strategic use of her time.

                                I spoke again to Michelle Nguyen, the
                                Adult Protective Services social
                                worker.  She reiterated that she wanted
                                to do a conference call with all of us.

                                1. I am guessing that Thursday would be
                                the best day to book something.  My
                                schedule is flexible, so I just need to
                                know what would work for both of you.

                                And when talking to her:

                                2. We should offer her documentation, as
                                it seems her investigative scope is limited.

                                3. IMO, we should let her know our
                                intention of suing for conservatorship. 
                                This then should put her in a mode of
                                thinking of (a) supporting it, (2)
                                giving helpful tips (perhaps even
                                attorney names), and (3) sharing her
                                experience of when a conservatorship
                                makes the most sense.

                                Thanks,
                                Huy
