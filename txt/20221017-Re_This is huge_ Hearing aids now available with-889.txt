Huy,

You are greatly good about getting intel on Dad and doing research. Woud 
you have time to help? My sense was that price was a big barrier when I 
talked with him about this before covid.

He was driving and left the turn signal on for about a mile after the 
lane change.  Inability to hear well is a serious impediment to driving 
safely.

    Good idea Hanh. Do you know if he will use it?  For some people it’s
    a vanity thing to admit that they need it. I can never tell with him
    if he will or won’t use it.

    I don’t know the difference between prescription or nonprescription
    but if we did it we should make sure it works well for him.

        Maybe we can get Dad a hearing aid for Christmas.  I heard that
        loss of hearing is a big factor in cognitive decline.  He will
        be visiting us from Dec 24-26.
