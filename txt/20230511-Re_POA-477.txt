Thanks.

We're in a good position to get Dad to sign the Durable POA. I'm fine if 
he gives you the POA, especially since you're doing the TRO/RO.

Make clear that if he tries to revoke this, Kim/Michele will immediately 
step in.

Don't waste your whole day.

Dad know you're coming?

H.

    Hi Hanh,

    How about this.  I go to SoCal with two possible POA forms for him
    to sign.  In order of preference:

    1. Durable POA.  (More powerful than a general POA.)

    2. Limited POA.  In this one, we list specific powers, like selling
    property.  We try to list as many things as possible so that it is
    almost like a General POA.

    What do you think?  This is something that only he has to sign.  So,
    you won't need to do any prep work.  The legal gist of it is very
    similar to the Advance Healthcare Directive, so you could look at
    that again to jog your memory.
