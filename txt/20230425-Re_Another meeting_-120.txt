    Good afternoon Michelle,

    We were wondering if another meeting with you tomorrow (Wednesday),
    anytime 1-2 or 3-4:30, for a duration of 15 to 30 minutes, is possible?

    As we processed the information exchanged last week, some questions
    came up.  We know for sure we will contact a lawyer very soon (most
    likely this week).  Perhaps we should let the attorney orchestrate
    legal matters (RO and eviction) rather than to do so ourselves right
    away.

    In particular with respect to RO's potentially to be filed on behalf
    of our father against his friend (Annalise) and his tenant (Ken), I
    am not sure if those actions will advance the conservatorship.  So,
    your additional input about issues of guardianship could help us
    with some planning.

    Best regards,
    Mark
