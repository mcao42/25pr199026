Mom talked to Geico yesteday. This confirms what Mom said all along that 
it was NOT her fault.

But there are so many questions this letter raised about the kind of 
decisions and action made on her behalf with full trust to take care of 
her. Why did mom not have collision insurance? How was that decision 
made? Was there an explanation to her last Oct about what was set up? 
What if she had been badly injured? How much was "saved" compared to all 
the costs and suffering she's going through now?

We will get quotes for more adequate coverage.
