Dear Michelle,

Our family greatly appreciates the care that Sterling has been providing 
to my father.

On Saturday, he expressed acute anxiety about his residence at the 
Columbia home.  He did the same on the previous weekend.  We had no idea 
what to make of this, other than to try and reduce his anxiety.  So, we 
decided to move him out one week early, with his final date at Columbia 
to be on Saturday, September 2nd around 12:30 PM (the flight will be 
departing around 3 PM).

I apologize that I couldn't give you more advance notice as to this 
change of plan.  I will make the final B&C payment on September 2nd.

My father's anxiety may be due more to his perception and depression 
rather than having a factual basis.  We do appreciate the attentiveness 
of your Columbia caregivers for my father in these past few weeks.

Best regards,
Mark

    Hi Mark-
    Thank you for the advance notice. Your dad is progressing well. We
    are starting him on a chopped diet today.
    We will try and increase his time in the wheelchair daily to prepare
    for the move.
    We will keep in touch regarding his improvements and move out.
    Take care
    Michelle

        Dear Michelle,

        This note is to let you know of my intention to have my father's
        move-out date from Sterling (15442 Columbia Lane in Huntington
        Beach) be Sunday, September 10th, 2023.

        He is gaining strength faster than we expected.  This move-out
        plan is consistent with our intention to have him be closer to
        us in Northern California, where we can more effectively
        participate in his care.

        Best regards,
        Mark
