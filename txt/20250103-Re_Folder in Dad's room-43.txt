    Hanh,

    I left a manila folder on Dad's bed shelf.  It has several items in it.

    - Corolla:

    1. In the folder is the car registration and 2025 sticker.

    2. For transfer, in the folder there is the car title and REG 256
    Statement of Facts. This is being done as a gift, with a tax
    advantage. I recommend you write GIFT in the Price of Sale field on
    the back of the title.

    3. A Bill of Sale is not needed. And there's also another transfer
    related form, but that is a seller-only form, which I am doing
    online today.

    - In the folder is also a business license fee statement Mom needs
    to pay, which is payable by phone. Also, I suggest you change the
    address for future use.

    As for car insurance, as you have added Mom to your insurance, I
    will be taking the Corolla and Accord off the Geico policy today.

    Thanks,
    Huy
