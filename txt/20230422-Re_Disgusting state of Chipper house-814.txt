Sadly, Dad is making good own case for action.

        I don't know why the tenants stick around. They must be
        desperate for housing.

            I was in the Chipper house today for about 10 minutes, but
            couldn't stand being in there.  Dad invited me to eat, and I
            said no thanks.

            There appear to be small insects (fruit flies?) hovering
            over the trash.  The floors look like they have not
            been mopped in a decade.  On the tables and counters, things
            pile up, so there is not a normal empty area for eating. 
            Hallways and walkways are lined with boxes and furniture,
            making walking around hard to do.

            You have to be there to believe it.  If you view pictures,
            it actually does not look bad.

            The absolutely worst thing is the strong bio odor.  It gets
            worse and stronger with each visit.  The smell is unique to
            his house, so honestly I don't know what it is exactly, but
            Michelle seemed to think there's a feces component to it.

            I had to drive Dad's car earlier today, so I sat where he
            usually sits.  The smell (feces?) stuck to me for about an hour.
