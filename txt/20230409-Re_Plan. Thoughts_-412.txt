    In my opinion
    Dad will have access to your report
    You only report the situation , let say objective, but based on
    superficial observation and “hearsay”  from his  tenant. I think
    that you do not have to be accurate and thorough on the report . You
    will tell sw  that there are a lot of unsolved problems ….
    You stress that you concern about his well being and the safety of
    the household.
    You live in the bay area and only visit him twice a year and you can
    not deal with the situation due to your  time constriction  and his
    non cooperation
    Senior social worker who will  be at the scene will  explore and go
    deeprooted into the problem. That is their job to do it
    Do not say anything that is not good for dad’d side, if he has to
    deal with what tenants accused him

            _*On Monday:*_

            I'll call Adult Protective Services and tell them my
            concerns about Dad.

            /Immediate concerns:
            /

            * He regularly drives without a valid driver license.
                - Recently he has been in several car accidents.  His
            car is possibly impounded now, following his last accident.

            * Threats and plots against one of the tenants (Ken).
                - Unsubstantiated allegations of rape against that
            tenant, which were part of an eviction attempt that was
            eventually dropped.

            * Illegal harassment of one of the tenants, for which Adult
            Protective Services was called around 4/6.  The harassment
            included physical assault (grabbing clothes and spitting)
            and removal of the tenant's refrigerator.

            * Health hazards:  House and kitchen are very dirty.  Feces
            all over at least one of the bathrooms.  Bio odor throughout
            the house.

            * Fire hazards:  blocked access ways.  Some smoke alarms are
            not working.

            * Tenants have not been informed of his mental diagnosis. 
            Thus they are exposed to a danger of which they are unaware.

            /Other concerns:/

            * He is not taking his meds.  He has a diagnosis of
            dementia and diabetes, but often skips his prescription meds.

            * Public indecency.  He walks around with his pants dropped
            below his buttocks.  He has incontinence issues but does not
            wear adult diapers.

            * Many police calls to the house (eight in the last three
            months), some of which are against him for complaints of
            assault.

            * Two pet cats in the home, possibly inhumane treatment of them.


            *_Long-term desire, for County to assist with:_*

            * Declare incapacitance.
                - All tenants should be informed, and sign an informed
            consent form.

            * Give the family some guidance for how to be granted full
            conservatorship.
