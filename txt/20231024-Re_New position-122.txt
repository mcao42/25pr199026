I saw that in his room. I thought you shared it with him already but let 
me read it with him. I'm curious whether he'll be able to read it by himself

    Thanks so much.  I'm not sure if Dad can read but I gave him a
    printout of the announcement.

            Hi,

            Here’s info on a new post that I’ve taken on. It’s not full
            time but a fun next step for me to learn.  I’ll also be
            doing some independent consulting.  A former SPR colleague
            and I just found out we won a nice contract with the Ford
            Foundation.

            Hanh
