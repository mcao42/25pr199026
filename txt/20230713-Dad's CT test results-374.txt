Huy... Any update on Dad?

His test results had very technical language but one of the things I saw 
from the CT scan was:  "There is extensive hypoattenuation in the 
periventricular white matter."

This suggests: Periventricular white matter hyperintensities increase 
the likelihood of progression from amnestic mild cognitive impairment to 
dementia.

Dad already has dementia but I wonder the effects of the stroke on his 
cognitive abilities.
