You’re making the assumption that dad declared the rent on his income 
taxes. Did you check with him about that? I think he had issues with his 
refinance because he couldn’t show a tax history of rent income.

    Hi Chu Y!

    I hope this email finds you well!  You are our go-to for accounting
    questions, and I have a big one.  Dad lived in part of the house
    while renting out the rest.  At one point, Dad added a granny unit
    ("duplex").

    Dad is considering selling his house (market value $1.2 million). 
    Cost basis is $82K.  Here are the methods of which we are aware to
    reduce or defer the capital gains tax:

    1. $250K exemption for single filer.  Dad has been single filing.
    2. Add home improvements to the cost basis (say, $300K).
    3. Try to use a 1031 exchange rule:
          - Dad lived in one part of the house.  Consider this part to
    be his primary residence.
          - The rest of the house, considered as an investment property,
    is eligible for deferring of capital gains tax.

    Using #3, I can see how he can avoid paying all capital gains tax,
    but it doesn't sound easy to do.  Any advice on how he can proceed?
