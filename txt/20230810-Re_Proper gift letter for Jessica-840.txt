Not good.

Btw. Did you see the tab in the password spreadsheet with Dad's 
accounting of his assets? I took a picture of his scrawl and also typed 
up to what he told me. I'm sure it's only a starting point.

    Last night, I found a proper gift letter from Jessica's mortgage
    company signed by Dad.  He signed it a couple of months after the
    money transfer.  At the time of the transfer, he had signed a gift
    letter that wasn't legally binding.

    So, if Jessica kept a copy of that gift letter, I think he can kiss
    the $60K good bye.

    I have been very busy fixing Chipper.  Will be able to provide an
    accurate snapshot of his financial situation in about two weeks,
    when I'm more freed up.
