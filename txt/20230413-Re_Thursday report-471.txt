The comment
"Basically, the police didn't take Ken too seriously."
was meant for the summary about Ken's police reports.

    Most interesting findings from today.

    * I went by the Chipper house.  Dad's black Corolla is not in great
    shape, but it is at the house (see attached, below).  To be honest,
    I can't tell if these dents are new or old.  I didn't notice them
    last time, but I was not looking for dents.  As you can tell, the
    dents are more or less noticeable, depending upon the viewing angle.

    * I texted to my cop friend.  She offered to have her friends pull
    over Dad, but unfortunately she thought he's in San Jose. 
    Basically, the police didn't take Ken too seriously.

    * I got the last 5 weeks of police/emergency reports (summary) from Ken.

          1. 3/7 "Hope Contact."  I don't know what this means.  Maybe
    has to do with Annalise's mental health ... That's my best guess.

          2. 3/18 Dad fell.

          3. 4/1 "415 disturbing the peace".  Ken reported that Dad
    grabbed him.  The police did not consider this an assault, just a
    dispute.

          4. 4/2 "919 keep the peace".  Ken reported Annalise was
    bullying him.  The police thought the elderly people were just
    arguing among themselves.

          5. 4/6 "919 keep the peace".  Ken reported Dad was banging on
    his door, demanding rent money.

          6. 4/7 "1021 phone call".  Ken reported Dad stole his food
    (frig).  Police think this is just people bickering.

          7. 4/7 "1021 phone call".  One hour later, Ken called the
    police again about the missing frig.  The police told him not to
    call again.
