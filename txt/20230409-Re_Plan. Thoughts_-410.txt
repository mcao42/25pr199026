Thank you Huy and Mom.

It's important to share the facts of what we know and what was provided 
to Dad.

The main thing I would add is that Dad went through a Memory Assessment 
on Feb 7, 2023 and received the attached letter from his doctor with the 
following diagnosis:

*Diagnosis-Dementia*

·Your health and safety is our priority hence we suggest that *you do 
not drive, as this will increase risk of accidents.***

·Please allow *help with making your healthcare and financial decisions* 
as we found that you may not have full capacity to make these decisions.

·Please *allow help at home*.


......

*_Regarding Department of Motor Vehicle (DMV) _*

*_Reporting_**;*

*California state law requires me to send a form to the Department of 
Public Health if there is a concern regarding safety while driving. They 
notify the Department of Motor Vehicles. I have no choice in this 
matter. ***

    The heater of the housese on oc is not important . I seldom turn the
    geat on!
    Always remember that dad will read your report
    No matter that he is rational or NOT. Until the rest of his llife
    The idea that his dear son  accursed him something that forces him
    out of his house and the life he wants to liive will broke his heart
    until his death. Belive or not, he will take a grudge against the
    reporter
    Let do the way that you are on his side, ignore what is bad he did.
    Let say, you heard what tenants said but you believe in yoi dad, you
    do not live there , you do not see rhings in depth and you
    believe   In what he said and you love him you tried to protect him
    unsuccessfully against those mean people
    I wanted to report, but i worried about the consequence on me and
    indirectly to you
    He or his  relatives will find me up hete to hurt me. They did not
    help him but they want to playRobinhood!, they are criminals and
    they can do any antisocial things

            In my opinion
            Dad will have access to your report
            You only report the situation , let say objective, but based
            on superficial observation and “hearsay”  from his  tenant.
            I think that you do not have to be accurate and thorough on
            the report . You will tell sw  that there are a lot of
            unsolved problems ….
            You stress that you concern about his well being and the
            safety of the household.
            You live in the bay area and only visit him twice a year and
            you can not deal with the situation due to your  time
            constriction  and his non cooperation
            Senior social worker who will  be at the scene will  explore
            and go deeprooted into the problem. That is their job to do it
            Do not say anything that is not good for dad’d side, if he
            has to deal with what tenants accused him

                    _*On Monday:*_

                    I'll call Adult Protective Services and tell them my
                    concerns about Dad.

                    /Immediate concerns:
                    /

                    * He regularly drives without a valid driver license.
                        - Recently he has been in several car
                    accidents.  His car is possibly impounded now,
                    following his last accident.

                    * Threats and plots against one of the tenants (Ken).
                        - Unsubstantiated allegations of rape against
                    that tenant, which were part of an eviction attempt
                    that was eventually dropped.

                    * Illegal harassment of one of the tenants, for
                    which Adult Protective Services was called around
                    4/6.  The harassment included physical assault
                    (grabbing clothes and spitting) and removal of the
                    tenant's refrigerator.

                    * Health hazards:  House and kitchen are very
                    dirty.  Feces all over at least one of the
                    bathrooms.  Bio odor throughout the house.

                    * Fire hazards:  blocked access ways.  Some smoke
                    alarms are not working.

                    * Tenants have not been informed of his mental
                    diagnosis.  Thus they are exposed to a danger of
                    which they are unaware.

                    /Other concerns:/

                    * He is not taking his meds.  He has a diagnosis of
                    dementia and diabetes, but often skips his
                    prescription meds.

                    * Public indecency.  He walks around with his pants
                    dropped below his buttocks.  He has incontinence
                    issues but does not wear adult diapers.

                    * Many police calls to the house (eight in the last
                    three months), some of which are against him for
                    complaints of assault.

                    * Two pet cats in the home, possibly inhumane
                    treatment of them.


                    *_Long-term desire, for County to assist with:_*

                    * Declare incapacitance.
                        - All tenants should be informed, and sign an
                    informed consent form.

                    * Give the family some guidance for how to be
                    granted full conservatorship.

                    Huy
