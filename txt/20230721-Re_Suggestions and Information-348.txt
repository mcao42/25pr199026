                Good Evening

                Thank you for your time on the phone and we look forward
                to helping you during this difficult time.

                *Board and Care (B&C)-* is a California state licensed
                care home in a residential community. They are licensed
                for six residents and two caregivers.  You pay one
                price, and all care is included. The homes have at least
                two caregivers, they sleep in the home at night.  If the
                resident needs anything they will get up and help them.
                However, if your loved one needs something at night,
                every night, he/she will need to go to a home with awake
                night staff. Thus, allowing them to get assistance with
                whatever they need 24/7. The average price is $4000 -
                5500 for a semi private room (may or may not include a
                bathroom). Private rooms start at $5500 - $8500.  Again,
                may or may not include a bathroom. Transportation is not
                included. Typically, there are not many activities
                offered in a B&C.  The advantage is your loved one will
                get more one-on-one care, and the price points are much
                lower. They will do activities around the table, walks
                and a "let's be seated" exercise video in the afternoon.
                Most homes have an activities director that comes in the
                home, and music as well.
                There are very few homes with true awake night staff.
                Not sure if dad will need it or not.

                *3:00 Ivy cottages*- Carmen owner - Has been in business
                for over 30 years. awake night staff, 6500, private
                room, outdoor area is very nice, older home but no
                clutter. Private room. The best care and great
                reputation. She has 3 caregivers in the daytime and 2 at
                night.

                included it.

                night staff, beautiful home and most rooms have a

                room private bathroom, and private patio, $5500 - 6000,

                Not sure if you want to go to Newport Beach area. - if
                so, we can see this home.

                *Mary's Loving Care -* owned by a Chinese family - and
                the mom is one of the caregivers. Small home, but very
                nice. The mom speaks perfect English. She has a private
                room/ awake night staff at this home, which gives the
                complete care that your dad may need. Nice home, just
                smaller, but great job with care. I have placed 3 people
                in this home, and the compliments about Mary are
                incredible. Her price points are great considering night
                staff and the area. $6000 - 6500, depending on the size
                of the room.
                341 16th Place, Costa Mesa, CA
                They do not have a website.


                All board & cares have a one-time admission fee. The
                average is $1000 for the B&C. You will still pay for
                medication, incontinent supplies if needed and
                supplemental drinks if he/she drinks them.
                Transportation is not provided in a board and care.

                We are a free service. My mother/partner was a nurse and
                Case Manager at Kaiser. We are a family business and
                have been placing loved ones for over 8 years! We have
                contracts with all facilities. We will try to work with
                budgets and geographic locations that work best for all
                family members. We will not suggest a facility or home
                where we would not feel comfortable placing our own
                loved one.
                Thank you for the opportunity to help you during this
                difficult time.  I am waiting on a few homes to get back
                to me.  I will continue to monitor openings and update
                you as I see great options.   Call me anytime with
                questions. I look forward to meeting you. We can meet
                tomorrow at 3p at Ivy Cottages.
