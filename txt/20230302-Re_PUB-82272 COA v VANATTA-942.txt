Miranda,

I have been trying to search OC cases by:
case number:  30-2023-01305196-CL-UD-CJC
plaintiff:  Ho Cao
defendant:  Ken Vanatta (the last named is purposely misspelt)
address:  16272 Chipper Lane, Huntington Beach, CA 92649

But no luck.  In early February, I was able to find the case.  Any idea 
why I can't find it?  I am trying to see if the defendant ever responded 
to the case.

Mark

        Hello, the filing has been received but has not been processed.
        Staffing challenges have created significant backlogs for these
        filings. At this time, I’m unable to give you a time estimate as
        to when it will be processed. We will try to get to it soon,
        thank you for your patience!
