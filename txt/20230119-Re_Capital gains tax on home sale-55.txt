Excellent point. We're brainstorming now so that we can ask a tax 
professional some good questions later.

    You’re making the assumption that dad declared the rent on his
    income taxes. Did you check with him about that? I think he had
    issues with his refinance because he couldn’t show a tax history of
    rent income.

        Hi Chu Y!

        I hope this email finds you well!  You are our go-to for
        accounting questions, and I have a big one.  Dad lived in part
        of the house while renting out the rest.  At one point, Dad
        added a granny unit ("duplex").

        Dad is considering selling his house (market value $1.2
        million).  Cost basis is $82K.  Here are the methods of which we
        are aware to reduce or defer the capital gains tax:

        1. $250K exemption for single filer.  Dad has been single filing.
        2. Add home improvements to the cost basis (say, $300K).
        3. Try to use a 1031 exchange rule:
              - Dad lived in one part of the house.  Consider this part
        to be his primary residence.
              - The rest of the house, considered as an investment
        property, is eligible for deferring of capital gains tax.

        Using #3, I can see how he can avoid paying all capital gains
        tax, but it doesn't sound easy to do.  Any advice on how he can
        proceed?
