My only job is to do what's best for Dad's living conditions. Within 
those limits, if I can help you, I will. But Elena's place is not an 
improvement for Dad's life.

Your business is your business, but I can give you advice as my mother. 
You can do many things to get what you want, including selling your home 
and coming to live near Dad; or, taking Uber for your trips from 
Hayward; or, getting your son-in-law Jeff to drive you to San Jose.  You 
have complained so much about Hang -- who accommodated my driving 400 
miles to Huntington Beach for 75% of my weekends between October 2022 
and August 2024. It sounds like Jeff is a very good in-law.  I'm sure he 
will help you.

And yes, I know driving can be a stress.  I almost lost my job doing 
that much driving.  While Hanh was busy "getting a very good job" as you 
brag about, I (who is just a lowly engineer) almost lost my job.

I empathize with you, but there is more going on here to help Dad have 
some peace and comfort for the rest of his life.

    Hi Huy,
    I have need waiting and waiting and just seen your email
    It is great that you have a favorable opinion about the condition of
    the bc
    To my opinion, dad really needs me to see him as often as possible
    With my frequent visit,his mentality and his physical health have
      noticeable improved
    On my part, at the age of 81, i chose to devote the rest of my life
    for dad no matter how much i have to struggle
    I have tried  very hard to stay strong, but i come to the point that
    i am exhausted and fear of  danger in driving and sleelessness
    Please weight those factors with the dis advantage in your
    consideration
    The past few months i have been under a lot of stress from driving
    long distance and spending time away from home, in order to have
    time to take care of dad
    I beg you to understand us and let dad move to Castro Valley
    Blessing  Home Assisted living
    We do not have much time to live!
    Dad and I have worked vey hard and went through a lot in our lives
    and we deserve a better. In our very difficult time!
    Simcerly,
    Your mother

        Hi Mom,

        I went to Castro Valley today after work to check out the
        assisted living facility. The positives about it include that
        Elena appears to be nice on a first impression, and her home was
        clean at the time I visited.

        Weighing advantages and disadvantages of moving Dad, I do not
        see any advantages for him of this new home; and I see some
        disadvantages. Because of that, it is best for him to stay at
        his current residence.

        Thanks,
        Huy
