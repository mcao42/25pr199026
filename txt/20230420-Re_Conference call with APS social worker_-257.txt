So it's a conference call and not by video yes?

                Hien and Hanh,

                I spoke again to Michelle Nguyen, the Adult Protective
                Services social worker.  She reiterated that she wanted
                to do a conference call with all of us.

                1. I am guessing that Thursday would be the best day to
                book something.  My schedule is flexible, so I just need
                to know what would work for both of you.

                And when talking to her:

                2. We should offer her documentation, as it seems
                her investigative scope is limited.

                3. IMO, we should let her know our intention of suing
                for conservatorship.  This then should put her in a mode
                of thinking of (a) supporting it, (2) giving helpful
                tips (perhaps even attorney names), and (3) sharing her
                experience of when a conservatorship makes the most sense.

                Thanks,
                Huy
