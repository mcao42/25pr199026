Hanh,

The transition is going to be easier than I thought, thanks in a large 
part to your arranging for the flight!

* I've let Sterling know that his last day will be Saturday, Sep 2nd.

On Saturday:

* He will be transported by a wheelchair-accessible van (Uber) from the 
HB B&C to LGB.

* Once at LGB, Southwest services will take over.

* Once he gets to San Jose, the same things happen in reverse.

* He has been signed up at the new place (Belmont Village at Santana 
Row, San Jose).

I have a message for his primary doctor, Dr. Susan Rose Hsu in 
Pleasanton.  With any luck, she will be ordering a hospital bed for him 
today or tomorrow that will be shipped by Apria to Belmont Village on time.
