Thx for the update.  I used to take core strength for granted.  Now I don't!

I hope that we can continue that Jessica started in N. CA.

    Re Jessica Epperson's first session with Dad:

    Her personal number is (714) 267-0868.  She is making it available
    for any questions that arise.  She works for a contracting company
    working with Kaiser. She will be doing two PT sessions per week.  I
    thought at first that she is doing an overall eval (including OT and
    ST), but she says no, she is just PT.  PT, OT and ST works a team.

    __

    She called me to ask for background info, so I told her how he was
    at his worst and what progress he has made.

    __She looked up what therapies are planned. Saw there is OT, but no
    speech therapy scheduled.  So, she will recommend speech to be
    booked for him.

    I told her we plan to move him to the Bay Area around September
    10th.  She says they will do as much as they can for him between now
    and then.  I told her my main concern is getting him from wheelchair
    to car, and vice-versa.

    I asked whether his leg now having strong movement implies anything
    about improved core strength.  She said not really, the two have to
    be worked on separately. He needs to practice sitting more, not just
    be in bed all day.  She will work with the staff to make sure he is
    sitting more each day.  As long as he can do so without slumping
    over, that's what she is going for.  Jessica confirmed Dad's leg was
    still moving.  (That's good, because after the headset came off on
    Sunday, he had said that became harder for him to move his leg
    again.  And I saw that when he moved his leg, the movement wasn't so
    strong.)

    He will need a special walker, which she will put on order, hoping
    KP will pay for it. The walker will be suitable for his condition of
    having very weak right upper body.
