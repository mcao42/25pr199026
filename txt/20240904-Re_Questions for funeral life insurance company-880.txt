    Mom,

    I just talked to Westminster Memorial Park.

    All burial contracts are either already under your name, or under
    your name and Dad's jointly, with you having right of survivorship.
    So, there is no hurry to sell them. After Dad passes away, you still
    have all rights to those properties to sell.

        Hi Mom,

        Here's the info.

        Company:  American Memorial Life Insurance, *(800) 533-2220.*
        Contract #:  6-489783 (Ho V Cao)
        Contract #:  6-489784 (Thanh X Huynh)
        Benefit _per_ contract:  $9,347.  Cash value:  $7,410.
        For prearrangement with:  Peek Family Funeral Home, 7801 Bolsa
        Ave, Westminster, CA 92683.

        I would call the life insurance company at the 800 number above.
        Just let them know you no longer live in Westminster, and that
        you are planning to sell all your cemetery and funeral
        contracts.  Then ask them whether the two prearranged funeral
        contracts can be transferred to a buyer.
