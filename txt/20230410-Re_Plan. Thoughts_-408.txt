    Huy,
    This is the way the system   worked when i was working for social
    services over 10  years ago
    -The social worker on duty of the day takes phone calls of the day
    and makes separate referrals for each case
    You do not need to go into details, but you manage to get more
    immediate attention and prompt action    to our case
    When the assigned worker call back for more detail you will refer to
    me or hanh
    -Emergency referral can go immediately to the supervisor. All
    referrals will be submitted to the supervisor who prioritizes the
    level of urgency and  assigns the case to workers of  the unit
    -Assigned worker then contacts with the caller for more details of
    the case.
    -He might request to make a home call with nurses, county Physician,
    policeman…for immediate action or interagency referral (mental
    health , financial assistances, housing assistance, fire
    department,  home shelter assistance…)

    -You will a be ask for  your name and phone number for more questions
    - you can mention about  my name as ex wife, hanh’s name for
    More information and send back ground information status

    - you should mention  about dad’s social status to get more
    attention or better treatment ,and for  more experienced or better 
    knowledgeable worker

            _*On Monday:*_

            I'll call Adult Protective Services and tell them my
            concerns about Dad.

            /Immediate concerns:
            /

            * He regularly drives without a valid driver license.
                - Recently he has been in several car accidents.  His
            car is possibly impounded now, following his last accident.

            * Threats and plots against one of the tenants (Ken).
                - Unsubstantiated allegations of rape against that
            tenant, which were part of an eviction attempt that was
            eventually dropped.

            * Illegal harassment of one of the tenants, for which Adult
            Protective Services was called around 4/6.  The harassment
            included physical assault (grabbing clothes and spitting)
            and removal of the tenant's refrigerator.

            * Health hazards:  House and kitchen are very dirty.  Feces
            all over at least one of the bathrooms.  Bio odor throughout
            the house.

            * Fire hazards:  blocked access ways.  Some smoke alarms are
            not working.

            * Tenants have not been informed of his mental diagnosis. 
            Thus they are exposed to a danger of which they are unaware.

            /Other concerns:/

            * He is not taking his meds.  He has a diagnosis of
            dementia and diabetes, but often skips his prescription meds.

            * Public indecency.  He walks around with his pants dropped
            below his buttocks.  He has incontinence issues but does not
            wear adult diapers.

            * Many police calls to the house (eight in the last three
            months), some of which are against him for complaints of
            assault.

            * Two pet cats in the home, possibly inhumane treatment of them.


            *_Long-term desire, for County to assist with:_*

            * Declare incapacitance.
                - All tenants should be informed, and sign an informed
            consent form.

            * Give the family some guidance for how to be granted full
            conservatorship.
