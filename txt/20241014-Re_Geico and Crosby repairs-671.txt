    Hi Mom,

    The total for recent reimbursements to me should be $1,761 = $700 +
    $1,061  which includes:

    _Geico car insurance:_

    $700 for the upcoming period 10/10/2024 to 4/10/2025.  This is based
    on a $2,467 policy premium, but cost is mostly based on mileage, and
    you drive less than Hang and I do. This compares to the original
    premium of about $2,000. I think car insurance is going up fast for
    everyone.

    Crosby repairs of the downstairs master bathroom totaled $1,061.
    That was for:

    * Toilet replacement
    * Faucet replacement
    * Vanity and sink replacement
    * Labor

    The cost breakdown:

    * Materials:  $661 = $391 + $270 (receipts attached)
    * Labor:  $400

    Maria gave feedback that she thinks Tai did a good job. The
    replacements of toilet and faucet were expected, but the vanity,
    including sink, were unexpected. The sink was in very bad shape (see
    photos of cracks on the top and bottom), so Tai recommended they be
    replaced now.

    Thanks,
    Huy
