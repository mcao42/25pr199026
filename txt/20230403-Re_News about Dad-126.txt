Well, if Dad's doing things that endangers himself or others, we need to 
go this route.

    The 5150D is what keeps happening to Annalise.  I think this is when
    she's doing something normally considered dangerously criminal
    (driving without a license), and the police don't really know what
    to do about it, so they'll impound her car and send her for a mental
    evaluation.

    Basically, we don't have visibility into what is happening.  If we
    did, there's probably some action we can take to get a
    conservatorship going.

        Yes, it sounds like a mess.  I don't know how Dad thought he
        could handle all of this on his own.  Lost his car, Ken's still
        there going bonkers, and Analisa is in charge.

        What is 5051?

            Hi Hanh,

            More of a mess happening in HB.

            So, looks like Ken can't handle the stress.  He has been the
            only person contacting me, so all the news is coming from
            him.  (Jeff won't reply to me, nor does Dad.  And, I don't
            bother contacting Annalise anymore.)

            * Dad went ahead with the request for restraining order
            against Ken, but the judge denied it.  I have no idea if
            they started a new restraining order, or continued the old
            one that I tried unsuccessfully to terminate.

            * In mid-March, Dad says he cancelled the 60-day eviction
            that I started on March 14th.  Yet, Ken is confused about
            whether the eviction is still going on.  Dad seems very
            confused about it.  He is still accepting rent from Ken,
            even though he seems to now want that eviction to go forward.

            * Ken says Annalise is basically running the house (playing
            dad like a fiddle) and is making life hell for him (Ken). 
            He definitely wants to move out, but it seems he doesn't
            have the money and is basically begging me for money.

            * Police have been called to the house many times by Ken. 
            He claims the police know Annalise is crazy, but they seem
            to consider all this a civil matter.

            * I asked Ken to verify that Dad's dark gray Corolla got
            dented in.  He says hadn't noticed, but when he checked the
            driveway, he didn't see that car.  So, there are three
            possibilities: (1) The accident was made up by Dad's
            relative.  (2) The car got impounded after the accident. 
            (3) Dad is getting the car fixed.

            To me, the most important thing is whether the police are
            going to do something about Dad (5150).  If something
            doesn't happen soon, I could see the situation getting out
            of control.
