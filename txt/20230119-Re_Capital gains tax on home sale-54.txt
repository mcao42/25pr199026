Hi Huy,
How are you and your family are doing?
We are doing fine here.

Regarding your tax question, it is beyond my expertise.  You / your dad should consult a tax expert on this matter.

I am tempting to say not to sell because the tax codes allow the house to be valued at its fair market at the time of the owner passes away, not owner’s tax basis (stepped-up basis).  So the heirs can sell it at that time without incurring a large tax bill.  However, since I don’t know his plans, his financial situations, his health condition, etc., I cannot give you/him any advice on what to do.

If your dad decides to talk to planners and/or tax experts, one of you should be there to gain the understanding and for your own benefits.

Call me when you have a chance.
Chú Ỵ
