Thanks for the update.

Can we request for them to discharge Dad next Thursday or Friday?

I need to take care of critical work meetings next Wednesday in LA and 
can focus fully on Dad after that.

Also, just booked a flight to LB 8/10-8/17.

    I spoke to Sein and profusely apologized for not returning her
    calls.  I gave her a number where I can check my voicemails more
    easily.  Here were the major points:

    * Dad's discharge is likely to be next week.

    * I told her B&C what we're favoring at the moment.  I also told her
    that I value Denise's recommendations, and that therefore we favor
    the place in Fountain Valley that Denise is having me visit first.

    * Doctor's visits:  Some places include it in the base fee, some
    places do not.  Depends on the specific B&C.  Sein is not indicating
    that doctor home visits are in the cards.

    * Therapeutic visits will be covered by KP.

    * The LT base fee covers nearly everything.  As long-term care
    facilities, it's just as the name describes, and they don't try to
    nickel and dime for diaper changes, etc.
