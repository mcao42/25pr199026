Hi Monique,

I am very concerned about my brother, Hien Cao, being assigned as the 
health decision maker for my father.  My father no longer wants this, 
due to my brother's complete silence and poor attitude since my father's 
illness six days ago.  My father expressed yesterday that I should be 
the decision maker, but I will see if he's amenable to my sister taking 
that role.

Should I get in contact with my father's doctor/case manager to see 
whether it is okay for him to sign another advance health-care directive 
at this time?  I believe he still has a presence of mind, but that his 
health will be declining even more in the future, so this may be the 
last viable opportunity to make this very important change.
