Hi Mom,

Here's the info.

Company:  American Memorial Life Insurance, *(800) 533-2220.*
Contract #:  6-489783 (Ho V Cao)
Contract #:  6-489784 (Thanh X Huynh)
Benefit _per_ contract:  $9,347.  Cash value:  $7,410.
For prearrangement with:  Peek Family Funeral Home, 7801 Bolsa Ave, 
Westminster, CA 92683.

I would call the life insurance company at the 800 number above. Just 
let them know you no longer live in Westminster, and that you are 
planning to sell all your cemetery and funeral contracts.  Then ask them 
whether the two prearranged funeral contracts can be transferred to a buyer.
