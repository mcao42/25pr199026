    Hi Mom,

    I suggest you do the following.

    1. Let the tenant know the handyman's schedule.  He thinks he can
    fix the moisture damage around mid-June.

    2. You will issue a 60-day notice to her, for tenancy ending
    8/31/2024.  So the notice should be issued 6/30/2024 or earlier.

    3. You should let her know what the new rental amount will be. 
    Otherwise, she will assume the worst and look for a new place.
