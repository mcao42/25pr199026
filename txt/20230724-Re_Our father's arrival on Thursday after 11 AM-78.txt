    Hi Michelle,

    Our father's case manager, Sein Jeong, rescheduled him to be
    discharged from The Pavilion at Sunny Hills (Fullerton) on Thursday,
    7/27 at 11 AM.  I am letting you know (probably reddantly), just in
    case.

    FYI, my sister, Hanh, will be at Sterling to help our father to
    transition to the home.  Would you please let the staff know, as needed.

    Best regards,
    Mark
