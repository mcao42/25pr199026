    Hi,

    Ms. Jeong, Dad's case worker, called. Based on the improved lab test
    results for Dad's kidney, Doctor Pelligrino plans to discharge Dad
    next Tuesday. Cherise Pratti will arrange transportation which
    family pays (~$200). All medical equipment have been ordered from
    Kaiser and set up at B&C, incl hospital bed ($25/mo), wheelchair
    ($25/mo rental), commode for shower and toilet ($25). Dad is
    responsible for 10% copay.
