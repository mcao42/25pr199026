You can transfer the texts to another phone. Do a backup to a computer 
then restore.

    Thanks.

    I found his phone has complete texts for years back.  So I want to
    keep the phone till after the Jessica case is done (roughly Jan 1,
    2024).

        claimed to Chu Y that Dad sent some sort of "sensitive" or
        incriminating texts to her.  Therefore, try to download as much
        of the call and text history as you can (but I believe it goes
        back only 18 months).  Only after that, please release the
        line.  Once the number is transferred to my account, T-Mobile
        tells me I cannot access past metadata.

        she has for evidence when discovery is performed.  Chu Y spoke
        slowly when talking about "sensitive" things that will ruin
        Dad's reputation.  Frankly I don't care, I can sniff out a liar.
