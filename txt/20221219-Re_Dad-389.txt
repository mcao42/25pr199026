Good lesson learned here.  His traveling doesn't sound like a good idea 
at all.

    I'm recovering from Covid, so not 100%, but based on my visit with
    him in Oct, it's clear that Dad had undergone severe
    decline--physically and cognitively. He can barely use his iphone or
    log into his email or other critical accounts. He's confused about
    his passwords no matter how many times we go through the info.

    He cannot manage his affairs. He'll need support to keep his house
    and manage his health. If he refuses, he may end up homeless or
    incapacitated.

    That's the conversation we need to have with him.

    Do you think he understands enough to fly to Oakland, Mom?

    H.

        He can’t take his phone to T-Mobile? Maybe Hanh can take him to
        T-Mobile on Saturday when he’s here.
