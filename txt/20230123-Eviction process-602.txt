Hi Dad,

To summarize, here is the eviction process, which could take two months 
to complete.

1. 3-day Notice to Quit.  Starts today, Monday, 1/23.

2. End of 3-day period will be Thursday, 1/26.

3. On Friday, 1/27, Legal Service Centers (hired by us) will file 
landlord's "Unlawful Detainer" complaint against Ken.  From that day, he 
has five days to respond.

4. Around 2/6, assuming no response from Ken, Legal Service Centers will 
file a Default on your behalf.

5. The Court processing of that Default could take 3 - 6 weeks.

6. Approximately in March, the Court will be able to close the case.  
Only by then will the County Sheriff be called to physically force out 
the tenant.

7. After the tenant has been forced out, only after that can you 
withhold services from him.  The most important service is that he will 
be unable to enter the house, as you will change the locks at that time.
