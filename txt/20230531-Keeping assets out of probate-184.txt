If you have assets owned jointly with Dad, please be aware that those 
will probably be wiped out upon his death.  The reason being, they would 
*not* have the Trust becoming the active beneficiary (rather, the 
co-owner will be) but they were co-owned by him.

The only example I've seen is an HSBC account co-owned by Hanh.  This 
account did not have much money in it, but that's beside the point.

I don't know how much Medicare/Medi-Cal he has used, but it seems he has 
used some.  I also don't know how much much debt he has (perhaps not 
much, with his FICO still being a decent 700).  I will keep his major 
assets out of probate to avoid their "recovery," but I won't be able to 
do that for unknown assets.

Thanks,
Huy
