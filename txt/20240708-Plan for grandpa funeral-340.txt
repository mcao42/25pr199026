This is  the text i have just sent to hien , chris and his children

Dear all,
Grandpa has been in hospice for several days after three days of 
hospitalization
I have already prepared for his last day, (cemetery, funeral home, 
ceremony with a Buddhist master ... )
except one last thing , the white headbands for his offsprings to wear 
in your presence at the 4 hour ceremony at the funeral home, that I am 
  preparing now!
If you can not attend his funeral due to distance, please let me know. I 
will have the head band (s) for you on the casket, ( instead of wearing 
it at the ceremony) that will go with him in cremation
Your  heart and your thought count! Don't feel bad if you can not attend!
If you have Skype i will let you talk to him , even though you can not 
understand him due to speech impairment
We will have a very small intimate ceremony wih only close family 
members , no other guests
Love,
Grandma
