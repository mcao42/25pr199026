When I reset the iPad and try to set it up for mom to use, it shows that 
the iPad is registered to the hvc_bus@yahoo.com 
<mailto:hvc_bus@yahoo.com> email and won’t let me set it up under mom’s 
Apple ID.

    Looks like no devices are registered anymore:

    I tried both account.apple.com <http://account.apple.com> and
    www.icloud.com <http://www.icloud.com>. Both lead back to
    account.apple.com <http://account.apple.com>. Also, I tried looking
    in the other left-hand sections, and all are empty.

        I'm trying to set up one of my old iPad for mom to use because
        she has trouble reading the emails on her iPhone.  The one that
        I'm trying to set up was set up with dad's apple ID.  It looks
        like you've changed dad's apple password.

        Can you either provide me with his new apple password or go into
        icloud and delete the ipad from his devices so that I can
        complete the set up for mom?

        Please reply to let me know that it's done.
