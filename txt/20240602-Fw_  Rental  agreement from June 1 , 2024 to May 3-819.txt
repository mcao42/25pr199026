    Hi Maria,
    Hope that you are back home from your vacation


        Attached is the rental agreement that I already signed (see last
        page that shows my signature).

        Maria, pleasr do the following ASAP:

        1. Print and sign. That attached rental contract
        2. Make a copy (with your signature).
        Then,
        keep one copy, and mail the other copy to me;
