Thanks for the update. So you need for me to go to OC? If yes,  I'm 
thinking of renting a car and driving down.

    Hanh,

    There were at least three CT scans done on him.  The first showed
    nothing.  The second (or it could be the MRI) showed a blood clot. 
    Then they did the third one because they suspected progression, but
    fortunately, the third scan did not show further clotting or other
    advances.

    The head nurse told me the stroke was complete, which I believe
    means the stroke has stabilized, and the test results are valid. 
    Here's where he currently stands:

    * verbal use of language, very poor.  He definitely has problems
    saying words, but the problem is more than motor skills.
    * right side of the body is much weaker than the left.  Poor control.
    * he has to both poop and pee in bed.
    * he seems to have discomfort more than any kind of pain.*
    * he seems a bit depressed.
    * cognitive abilities are poorer than when I saw him last weekend. 
    Hopefully that is just temporary.

    Today, the PT and occupational therapist will both evaluate, and
    recommend a plan for transfer to rehab.  Given his condition and
    situation, you would think they would recommend an inpatient setting
    for the next stage, but I understand these decisions are financially
    driven.

    If they do recommend an outpatient arrangement for rehab, I don't
    know how that could possibly work from OC.

        Huy... Any update on Dad?

        His test results had very technical language but one of the
        things I saw from the CT scan was:  "There is extensive
        hypoattenuation in the periventricular white matter."

        This suggests: Periventricular white matter hyperintensities
        increase the likelihood of progression from amnestic mild
        cognitive impairment to dementia.

        Dad already has dementia but I wonder the effects of the stroke
        on his cognitive abilities.
