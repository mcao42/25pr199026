Well, I try to refrain from judging him.  I took to heart Kim Swanson's 
words regarding how Dad's resistance to giving up control is completely 
normal, regardless of his degree of dementia.

He never asked us for help.  To his own detriment, he relied on people 
like Jeff and Annalise for mutual help, and they were actually of no 
help at all when he needed it.

He didn't ask for help but he knew he no longer could be independent.  
He gladly accepted help when it was offered on his terms.  And in truth, 
he had every right to demand that.  I put myself in his shoes, and I 
also would not agree to being helped on someone else's terms if it feels 
condescending.

Regarding being in the Bay Area in February, he left open the 
possibility of being helped only if he could still have his assets 
working for him (starting a rental in San Jose).  He never indicated 
that he was happy with liquidating all assets, followed by spending it 
for the remainder of long-term care.

This is a long way of saying that I don't think he meant to be selfish.  
He did not put himself in a position of being a burden on others.

Lastly, I point to his being proud, which he had to be, living in a city 
dense with bigots, Huntington Beach.  I am so glad I moved away from 
there.  It's a pity Dad didn't realize he would have been much happier 
personally elsewhere.

    Dad has to do everything the hard way out of pure selfishness.  If
    he hadn't insisted leaving the Bay Area, he wouldn't be a prisoner
    of his own body right now.

            Thc for the recap. What's clear is that it's hard to undo
            years of neglect.  Dad's smart and knowlingly went down the
            path he did.

                * Doc mentioned about how Dad didn't do any visits for
                about 3 years, and that his non-compliance contributed
                to his blood sugar getting out of control.

                * Regarding the stroke, I told the doc about Dad's
                recent improvements.
                    - Speech much easier to understand.  Eating is much
                more normal, with no coughing and being able to eat
                Vietnamese chao.
                    - right leg also seeing significant improvement,
                with flexing now doable.
                    - he has always been able to listen and understand
                and doesn't seem to have aphasia.
                    - right arm still completely limp.
                    - He has gotten a bit more feisty (cantankerous)
                since he became stronger.

                * The doc and I discussed Dad moving to another B&C in
                Northern California.  Doc is totally fine with this and
                thinks it's better for Dad to be near family.

                * He thinks SoCal and NoCal KP are not "stoved piped"
                and are fairly seamless in transferring services.  So if
                the patient has therapy benefits, they should transfer
                to the new location.

                * I mentioned we're considering professional
                non-emergency medical transport, but he believes that is
                not necessary for Dad's case.

                * He says one of the main concerns about Dad remains
                kidney function.  Metformin can adversely affect kidney
                function, and for that reason, was discontinued.
