    Hi Mom,

    Here is what I told you over the phone yesterday:

    The cemetery listing has *not* been posted yet. Nobody has seen it
    yet, except for the people who run the website.

    Any part of it can be edited at any time, including the price.

    I think what you have is only worth $22,000 in the third-party
    Marketplace. So that's what I proposed to be posted. But I said I
    could be wrong about that. And, again, nobody has seen the $22,000
    listing yet. Because it has not been posted to the public.

    If I can help you in any way with this listing, just let me know,
    and I will provide you with the information you need. For now, I'm
    freezing the posting so the public won't see it.

    Thanks,
    Huy
