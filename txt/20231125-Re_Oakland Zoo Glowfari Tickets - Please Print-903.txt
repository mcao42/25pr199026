In that case, we should meet you at your home.  I'll put this on our 
calendar.

    Hi Huy and Hang,

    I'm so glad you can join us to see the Animal Light Lantern Festival
    at the Oakland Zoo!

    Attached are your tickets.  Please print.  They admit groups by time
    slots.  If you want to caravan, please meet at our place by 5p OR
    meet us at the zoo entrance by 5:20 to go in.  I should accompany
    you to go in.  Not sure how carefully they check members' IDs.
