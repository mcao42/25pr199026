I had a conversation with Dad this morning.  Lots of background details, 
but here is a summary of Dad's plan, which I think is sound.

1. On 2/18, Dad and I will drive to HB.

2. We will talk to Ken and come to a friendly agreement that he pays for 
February and March rent; and he will move out at the end of March.

3. Dad expects no kind of confrontation with Ken, since all the domestic 
conflict was between Annalise and Ken.  Dad will make sure Annalise 
stays away from the house.

4. Dad will then stay permanently in HB.

Thanks,
