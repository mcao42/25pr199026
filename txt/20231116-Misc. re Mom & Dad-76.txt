Hi Hanh,

A lot of loose ends:

Mom:

* Passport renewal.  Since her trip is next month and her passport does 
not expire until July, I discouraged her from trying to renew her 
passport now.

* Visa for Vietnam.  Looks like this should be doable, with just a 
three-day time for processing.  Will try to help her with this.  But I 
encouraged her to buy from a Vietnamese travel agent in the future.  
Their tickets are just as cheap as online sources, and they can do visa 
applications in their sleep.

Dad:

* Fell off his bed again last night.  It seems intentional.  They said 
his bedrails were still up.  I haven't talked to him about this yet.  He 
has been in a fairly good mood in recent days, so I'm thinking he could 
have been just horsing around??

* Doctor.  He has his first appointment with Dr. Yap, his new PP, this 
Friday.  I'm going to try and get as much done as possible, including 
updates to prescription drugs.

* Ivy Park (Evergreen). This is the new place that he will be moving 
into around December 1st.  His payments will be slightly less there than 
Oakmont, even though they will be providing to him their highest level 
of service.  This is actually kind of good, since he is demanding and 
high maintenance.  I am hoping this will be a good match for him.  I'm 
going to emphasize to him that this is as good as it gets, and that it 
would almost certainly be worse at a B&C.
