I told Dad about your decision. His feelings did not appear to be not 
hurt. Until I get the paperwork changed, in the unfortunate event that 
he would pass away beforehand, please just send any cash you get from 
Dad's inheritance directly and completely to Hien.

Hien will be the beneficiary of the injury settlement and all the other 
liquid assets.

Regarding your last sentence, I agree with you in theory. But in 
practice, this is the same approach suggested by the investigator, which 
dad has explicitly rejected. There are many large risks of losing 
Independence completely and especially of being in the care of total 
strangers.

The situation with the greedy Annalise is reaching a crisis point. It 
looks like she's out-foxing dad.

        Thank you. Yes, I already took you off as primary trustee. You
        are now the first contingent trustee. Per your wishes, I will
        let dad know and take you off as any kind of beneficiary.

        If you are unwilling to serve any kind of role in the healthcare
        directive, that also would be good to know.

        It's not good to involve the neighbors in this. As I hinted
        before, at least one of the neighbors is a bigot. Dad asked one
        of his neighbors to be a witness for these signings, so
        revisions is not something I want to do regularly.

            I'd like to be taken off the list as Dad's beneficiary and

            role, Huy because of the power of attorney.

            I don't want to speak for Hien. He can let you know himself,
            his preference.

            All I meant to say was I prefer for you to be the
            beneficiary since you've been doing all of the work to take
            care of Dad.

                After months of preparation of Dad's docs and finances,
                in which I kept you in the loop, Hanh texted to me
                several days ago.  It must have taken Hanh several
                seconds to do this.  She texted her preference to have
                Hanh and Hien be removed as any kind of beneficiary for
                Dad's assets (I can provide a screenshot if that is needed).

                As I stated before, any kind of decision like this is
                fine with me.  It's equitable.  Mom will be subtracting
                from or outright removing anybody favored by Dad to
                assure equity.  And this is fine with me to have Mom
                opposing what I am doing for my parent.  I absolutely
                cannot do the right thing for my aging parent if Mom
                imposes her conditions on how I help my parent.

                Please, know that it takes significant resources, the
                most valuable of which is time, to do these things.  But
                it seems worthwhile to do Dad's documents once to get it
                right.  If you are unwilling to be:

                * his trustee (someone he can rely on)
                * his beneficiary

                then please let me know now so I can help redo his
                documents, just one more time.

                There is a lot of urgency to these tasks because of (1)
                his age and (2) things like his $250K settlement for
                which his lawyer does not seem to be in any hurry to
                close.  Therefore beneficiary assignments are needed.

                Thanks,

                Huy
