Also I should mention, Das was definitely flirty, but Jessica didn't 
flirt back.  She did send back a lot of heart emojis, though.

    Okay, I can do this probably within a week.

    The threat by Jessica, passed along by Chu Y, turns out to be
    comical.  Hang and I went through all the texts on Dad's phone from
    Jessica as well as a younger woman introduced to Dad by Jessica. 
    Tame stuff.

    Hang's Vietnamese is stronger, my English is stronger.  The texts
    were a combo of English and Vietnamese.  Here's the worst of it.

    1. Dad texted to Jessica about how lonely he was without a wife, and
    that he "needed the scent of a woman," and asked Jessica if she
    could "help."  She replied no, she couldn't do that.  If that was
    part of her legal strategy, she sure didn't plan ahead well.

    2. Dad did text to "insist" that the $20K (of the total of $60K) was
    to be "accepted" by Jessica.  Ambiguous language, leaving a lot of
    room for plausible deniability.  Still, that's the worst of his
    texts from a legal perspective.

    3. Apparently Dad had a short sugar-daddy relationship with someone
    introduced to him by Jessica.

    There is nothing there at all for a counterclaim.  I think Jessica
    cherry-picked a couple of texts to show Chu Y, which probably
    shocked him when read out of context.  The whole context of the
    texts is that Dad was lonely (in the time before he picked up
    Annalise) and Jessica was like a counsellor to him.

        You can transfer the texts to another phone. Do a backup to a
        computer then restore.

            Thanks.

            I found his phone has complete texts for years back.  So I
            want to keep the phone till after the Jessica case is done
            (roughly Jan 1, 2024).

                Jessica claimed to Chu Y that Dad sent some sort of
                "sensitive" or incriminating texts to her.  Therefore,
                try to download as much of the call and text history as
                you can (but I believe it goes back only 18 months). 
                Only after that, please release the line.  Once the
                number is transferred to my account, T-Mobile tells me I
                cannot access past metadata.

                about "sensitive" things that will ruin Dad's
                reputation.  Frankly I don't care, I can sniff out a liar.
