Good Morning Cherise,

I want to let you know that I talked to the team at the B&C for my 
father. They already have a hopital bed and commode. So, i spoke to an 
Apria rep to only rent the wheelchair. They also mentioned that the 
delivery would be delayed to today.

Can you let Sein know as needed?

Thank you,

Hanh Yu
