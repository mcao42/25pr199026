Hien,

Please, step up and take the health role seriously.  I asked Dad why in 
the world he ever chose you as his health agent.  He responded that it 
was a good idea because you worked for Kaiser.

The health-care agent is supposed to know Dad's values and be respectful 
of them.  Please, learn about what Dad values and, above all, respect 
them.  Your passivity since Dad's illness is absolutely beyond the pale 
and unacceptable.
