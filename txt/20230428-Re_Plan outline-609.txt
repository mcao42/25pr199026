        _4/28_ - Huy calls Dad, tells Dad that Michelle has talked to us
        (children) about serious concerns about Dad’s well-being.  She
        reports that Dad is having problems both taking care of himself
        and the house. Furthermore, she has applied for a public
        guardian.  This means that the County eventually will come up
        with a plan for Dad that will use his assets to provide for
        24-hour care for him.  Ultimately this means a loss of financial
        and individual freedom for Dad, and probably separation from
        Annalise.

        The alternative is for Dad to let the Living Will take effect,
        by voluntarily ceding POA to Hanh. This is a better alternative
        that will keep Dad’s freedoms.  The family will better protect
        Dad’s best interests than a public agency.

        We (the children) would like to help Dad, but we can do so only
        after the POA goes into effect.  Our plan consist of:

        1.Cleaning Chipper house, fixing it, and selling it.

        2.Moving Dad to a new living situation in the Bay Area, where we
        can oversee both health and living situation.

        /Comment:  Dad will probably say no at first.  But when public
        guardian and doctors actually contact him, he will then think
        about this./

        _Early May_ – We meet with Dad and the lawyer to modify the
        Living Will.
