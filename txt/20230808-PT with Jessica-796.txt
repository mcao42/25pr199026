Re Jessica Epperson's first session with Dad:

Her personal number is (714) 267-0868.  She is making it available for 
any questions that arise.  She works for a contracting company working 
with Kaiser. She will be doing two PT sessions per week.  I thought at 
first that she is doing an overall eval (including OT and ST), but she 
says no, she is just PT.  PT, OT and ST works a team.

__

She called me to ask for background info, so I told her how he was at 
his worst and what progress he has made.

__She looked up what therapies are planned. Saw there is OT, but no 
speech therapy scheduled.  So, she will recommend speech to be booked 
for him.

I told her we plan to move him to the Bay Area around September 10th.  
She says they will do as much as they can for him between now and then.  
I told her my main concern is getting him from wheelchair to car, and 
vice-versa.

I asked whether his leg now having strong movement implies anything 
about improved core strength.  She said not really, the two have to be 
worked on separately. He needs to practice sitting more, not just be in 
bed all day.  She will work with the staff to make sure he is sitting 
more each day.  As long as he can do so without slumping over, that's 
what she is going for.  Jessica confirmed Dad's leg was still moving.  
(That's good, because after the headset came off on Sunday, he had said 
that became harder for him to move his leg again.  And I saw that when 
he moved his leg, the movement wasn't so strong.)

He will need a special walker, which she will put on order, hoping KP 
will pay for it. The walker will be suitable for his condition of having 
very weak right upper body.
