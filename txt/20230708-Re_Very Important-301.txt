Thank you. Yes, I already took you off as primary trustee. You are now 
the first contingent trustee. Per your wishes, I will let dad know and 
take you off as any kind of beneficiary.

If you are unwilling to serve any kind of role in the healthcare 
directive, that also would be good to know.

It's not good to involve the neighbors in this. As I hinted before, at 
least one of the neighbors is a bigot. Dad asked one of his neighbors to 
be a witness for these signings, so revisions is not something I want to 
do regularly.

    I'd like to be taken off the list as Dad's beneficiary and primary
    trustee. I had assumed that you've taken on that role, Huy because
    of the power of attorney.

    I don't want to speak for Hien. He can let you know himself, his
    preference.

    All I meant to say was I prefer for you to be the beneficiary since
    you've been doing all of the work to take care of Dad.

      H.

        After months of preparation of Dad's docs and finances, in which
        I kept you in the loop, Hanh texted to me several days ago.  It
        must have taken Hanh several seconds to do this.  She texted her
        preference to have Hanh and Hien be removed as any kind of
        beneficiary for Dad's assets (I can provide a screenshot if that
        is needed).

        As I stated before, any kind of decision like this is fine with
        me.  It's equitable.  Mom will be subtracting from or outright
        removing anybody favored by Dad to assure equity.  And this is
        fine with me to have Mom opposing what I am doing for my
        parent.  I absolutely cannot do the right thing for my aging
        parent if Mom imposes her conditions on how I help my parent.

        Please, know that it takes significant resources, the most
        valuable of which is time, to do these things.  But it seems
        worthwhile to do Dad's documents once to get it right.  If you
        are unwilling to be:

        * his trustee (someone he can rely on)
        * his beneficiary

        then please let me know now so I can help redo his
        documents, just one more time.

        There is a lot of urgency to these tasks because of (1) his age
        and (2) things like his $250K settlement for which his lawyer
        does not seem to be in any hurry to close.  Therefore
        beneficiary assignments are needed.

        Thanks,

        Huy
