Hien and Huy,

I've been numb and trying to hold it together since the news of Dad's 
stroke, but reading through your emails today opened the floodgate of 
tears.

Mom's message comes from a place of love.  We are imperfect and a family 
that's been through a lot.

I see both of you, your _good_ intentions, your hearts, and how hard 
you've worked, and how you've expressed your love for Dad in your own 
ways.  Huy has put in countless hours on the road, in the HB house, 
settling Dad's messy affairs, and listening to him.  Dad's situation 
can't be any more complicated.  When I'm with him, although he can't 
talk, he feels our sadness and our tensions.  At this time, he needs to 
feel our love and unity as his days are numbered.

Please set aside your differences and come together to see Dad 
to a peaceful end.

Love,
Hanh

    Dear Hien Hanh Huy.
    I  have  just come back from the gym and read your email
    Right   Now, i am very very  very sad
    All in my mind is Dad wellbeing  but nothing else
    I understand Dad who has very kind heart but  he has been taking
    advantage by a lot of people, women, his relatives ….
    I regret the he did not take care of himself

    All we need to do now is not to let those things damage his life
    anymore and keep the value of  his financial assets for the rest of
    hos life

    All i am thinking now is just leave everything the way it is
    All we need to do is his well being . We respect him as long as he lives
    Dad is a decent person we should respect all of his decisions and
    leave his money and his property as long as he lives
    I pray that if his mental status improves he will be back to the Dad
    that we had before as much as possible
    If he can get out of nursing home, we will find a decent assisting
    living hime for him
    When  i lost my CADL i found Stoneridge  assisting living which
    somebdy compare it as a five star hotel
    The most important thing we need to do is to keep others from taking
    advantage of his hard earned money, until his death
    Anything left after his death will for his  children
    I can  even help with the money i have
    I do not know how long I live, can be one day , can be 50 more years
    , but i am willing to help financially. i have very little expense
    for daily life. It is very painful to see him at the hose in
    Huntinton Beach
    I do now know how long he can live
    If his living condition changes he can live longer as a decent person.
    Love,
    Mom
