Any other fees? What do these cover?

    Hanh,

    Here are the basics.  She quoted best prices first, for Garden Grove
    or Westminster:

    * $3,500 - 4000 for a shared room
    * $5,000 for a private room

    I asked her about premium, and she said $7,000 for HB.

    Will tour later this week, Wednesday or Thursday.  Will keep you posted.
