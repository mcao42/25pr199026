Thanks Hien.  The timing of the metformin and evening testing has never 
been made clear in any of the written instructions.

I can call around 3:30 today to talk to Ms. Morris.  Can you setup a 
time then to make sure she's available.  I can give the blood pressure 
info.  It's not been good.

H.

    Hi Ho and family:
    I work in the diabetes office and received a referral to help with
    your diabetes care. The metformin medication is best taken at the
    very end of the meal with food still in the stomach to avoid upset
    stomach or loose stools.
    I was reviewing your blood glucose results. It looks like the
    fasting blood glucose are nearly all in target range of 100-140
    mg/dl. When you check the blood glucose in the evening, is this
    before dinner, two hours after dinner or at bedtime?
    The goal for blood glucose:
    before dinner or any meal is 100-140 mg/dl.
    Two hours after dinner less than 200 mg/dl.
    At bedtime 100-200 mg/dl.
    Eating the non-starchy vegetables first with meals does help to
    blunt the rise in blood glucose. Aiming for 1/2 the plate to be
    non-starchy vegetables also helps to limit the amount of rice or
    noodles consumed with the meals.
    I noticed that his blood pressure was above target back in January.
    Are you checking his blood pressure at home? If so, what have you
    been getting for his results including the pulse?
    It's important that we keep his blood pressure and blood glucose in
    range to keep his kidneys healthy.
    Please call me when you have time to discuss his diabetes care. My
    direct number is 925-243-2718. You can also e-mail me and let me
    know a good day/time to call you.
    Best Regards,
