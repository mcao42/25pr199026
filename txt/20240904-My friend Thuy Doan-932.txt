  If you are interested I will ask my friend, Thuy Doan to release her 
phone number to you
Thuy Doan, my  class mate in the university of public administration
She is very smart and kind hearted, a woman of dignity
She  graduated master degree valedictorian and got USaid scholarship 
like dad but she relinquished that honor and got married.
In 1975, she started her life in USA, working as a nurse aid to help her 
husband to go back to school , becoming veterinarian
All i leaned about handling dentures, living with a diabetic husband, 
and board and care  experience are from her and two other friends
