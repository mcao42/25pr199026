Jeff,

When I filled out the REG 262 over the weekened, I wrote my driver's 
license number instead of Dad's.  Well, I am pretty sure that's not 
correct, so I went to the DMV in Los Gatos today to get advice and/or a 
new REG 262 form. Unfortunately, it got more complicated from there.  
Just as I suspected, apparently these employees have differing 
interpretations of how to fill out these various forms.

She said to me:
(1) The date correction should have been done simply using REG 101 
Statement to Record Ownership, on the back of which is a "Statement of 
Error or Erasure." She gave me a form, but it's just on plain paper; so, 
fortunately it's likely to be downloadable if another blank is needed.
(2) I shouldn't have signed as POA the way I did. Dad, despite his 
dementia, could at least initial the title. And he must do that, she 
said.  She implied that a replacement title does not have to be 
obtained, and that the extra owner's signature (Ho Van Cao) can be done 
on the existing form.

I think she might be right about #1, but I doubt she is right about #2 
(although she insisted she is right).  Let me know if you have good 
ideas about how to proceed. Personally, I think best is one of the 
following:

(A) Use the REG 101 to note the mistake of the date on the title; or,
(B) Use a REG 227 (Application for Duplicate title) and start from scratch.

I think there is a good shot that (A) will be accepted. But if we want 
to be sure, we do (B).

           Mom tried to take the title transfer material to AAA today to
    file, but they did not accept it since the date had been changed
    (even though initialed).  The DMV site/handbook says errors on the
    title are not accepted, so they gave her REG 252
    (https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/handbook/vehicle-industry-registration-procedures-manual-2/odometer-mileage-reporting/vehicle-vessel-transfer-and-reassignment-form-reg-262/

    to fill out.  This one is not available online since the original is
    required to be filled out on security paper. We filled it out but is
    requires your signature. She would like to mail the form to you
    today.  She/we can drop it to the post office if this makes sense.

         The Statement of Facts (form 256) looks ok.

    Thanks,

    Jeff

        Hanh,

        I left a manila folder on Dad's bed shelf.  It has several items
        in it.

        - Corolla:

        1. In the folder is the car registration and 2025 sticker.

        2. For transfer, in the folder there is the car title and REG
        256 Statement of Facts. This is being done as a gift, with a tax
        advantage. I recommend you write GIFT in the Price of Sale field
        on the back of the title.

        3. A Bill of Sale is not needed. And there's also another
        transfer related form, but that is a seller-only form, which I
        am doing online today.

        - In the folder is also a business license fee statement Mom
        needs to pay, which is payable by phone. Also, I suggest you
        change the address for future use.

        As for car insurance, as you have added Mom to your insurance, I
        will be taking the Corolla and Accord off the Geico policy today.

        Thanks,
        Huy
