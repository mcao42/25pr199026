Hi Huy,

I have some Qs to get me ready for this week with Dad.

1) Is he fully up to speed on the discharge and the B&C he's going to?

2) Where is he with regards to Analise? Does he know she's still at the 
house?

3) Did you find his iPad? If not, I thought he might want to watch video 
and hear Buddhist chants with an old phone that I have through wifi, 
assuming the B&C has wifi.

4) Shall I bring to the B&C some more clothes and maybe some books? Did 
you already bring clothes to him?  I'll ask him if there's anything else 
he wants to make his room more homey.

5) Anything else?
