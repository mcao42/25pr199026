Karina, the laywer, called today.  Here's what she told me.

The medical expense is a whopping $165K.  And this is why Dad's share 
will be smaller than expected.  Dad had asked them to assure him that he 
will get a final amount of $60K.  The two sides agreed to that.  
The $60K will come to Dad as a lump sum.

Karina says the $250K will come almost immediately from the insurance 
company, but it could take as long as 3.5 months for the medical 
negotiation to be completed.  (If the $60K is guaranteed, it's a mystery 
why they have to wait 3+ months to cut a $60K check.)

Karina says 2 months for the final $60K is more realistic.  I asked her, 
given Dad's current condition, shouldn't we (Dad) sign a beneficiary 
letter to avoid going to probate for the $60K.  Karina says drafting a 
beneficiary letter is not worth the trouble.  She didn't spell out what 
she meant, but I believe what she means that if Dad dies before the 
medical expenses are reduced, the law firm will simply cut a $60K pronto 
to Dad's name.  Then the beneficiary of one of his bank accounts would 
deposit the check before presenting the bank with the death certificate 
to empty all funds.

    Hien,

    Dad signed the "Release of All Claims" today.  Some details of what
    Dad will get.

    * 250K (gross)
    - minus 45% lawyer's fee on the gross
    - minus court related costs
    - minus medical expenses

    I recommended to Dad a structured settlement (annuity) rather than a
    lump sum.  Dad will be designating you as the sole beneficiary as
    soon as that is allowed, so that you wouldn't have to go to probate
    court.
