I do not wish for any further contact from either of you.  This is because:

1. You are disrespecting Dad's explicit wishes at the time he was fully 
in charge of his own decision making. To the contrary, you made 
derogatory comments about him at the time when he was fully verbal.

2. Jacquelyn Huynh told me "You are no longer my son."

3. Hanh Yu told me that I am trying to kill Dad out of greed.

The only reason I am not blocking your emails and texts is, people can 
change.  Your next communication to me should start, "I apologize for 
-----."  If that is not your next email, we do not have anything to talk 
about on a personal level.

I will answer emails from you about necessary things for Dad. But please 
keep it strictly professional.

Sincerely,
Huy Cao
