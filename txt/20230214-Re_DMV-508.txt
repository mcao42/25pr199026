Agree.
-In the last few years Hien is almost the only one who fix my computer 
and ipad So i am ok with it
He has  a device to access  my computer from his home
About porn,
It is a disease
He had it since you were small children. He bought Playboy magazines and 
rent x movies
I think that was a sickness and is immoral  i felt very nausea about it. 
I told him that we had small children at home
I fought with him several times about it , but he kept doing it. 
I threw  them in the trash each time
About porn movies, Dear Abby said that  it is not illegal and it is 
personal  right. So, i  I ignore it
He is also a compulsive gambler
I am sure  that he has anti social behavior . It is in v blood. Also 
things like that are i in his family
Even God can not fix  it
I had  to be strong , very strong to live with that person for over 
forty years
Once he was very crazy and rude with me at the airport, i could not hold 
it and said:
“ i do not know why a person like me cam live with you!’
Any time he acted out, i could see other people gave him a dirty look 
that is enough  for me
When he verbally abused me. I said that “i was nor raised with those 
trash. Record it and play it back to the people who educated ypu”

        I was surprised that Dad is so open about watching graphic porn
        in front of us.  He asked mom and us to provide him a desk lamp
        so that it can provide a more focused light for him to see.

        When he comes to your place, Huy, watch out for use of his
        laptop in front of your children.

            Dad needs his other laptop and his iPad. He can use them for
            his video visits.

            The laptop he has with him is mostly used by him to watch porn.

            You need to verify that he has those items before leaving HB.

                    Hanh - I remembered what you asked me to help with -
                    the DMV response.  Below is the excerpt regarding
                    the DMV in Dr. Datta’s message.  It predicated on
                    the assumption that dad has a valid drivers
                    license.  I don’t think he does.  If he truly
                    doesn’t, I’m not sure that there’s a lot of do in
                    response.

                    Regarding Department of Motor Vehicle (DMV) reporting;
                    California state law requires me to send a form to
                    the Department of Public Health if there is a
                    concern regarding safety while driving. They notify
                    the Department of Motor Vehicles. I have no choice
                    in this matter.
                     From the DMV: 'Driving is an activity that uses a
                    number of cognitive skills
                    <https://hswprodnbm.appl.kp.org/portal/dmv/?1dmy&urile=wcm:path:/dmv_content_en/dmv/about/senior/health/exercise> in
                    a complex manner. These cognitive skills include
                    memory, visual processing, attention, and the
                    ability to analyze driving-related situations to
                    make appropriate decisions. Medical conditions and
                    medications common to seniors have an impact on
                    cognitive abilities.
                    Your muscle strength, endurance, flexibility, and
                    muscle reaction to stimuli are all necessary for
                    operating your vehicle and for turning your head to
                    view traffic. Age-related physical changes and
                    musculoskeletal diseases (such as arthritis) may
                    affect your ability to drive safely and comfortably.'
                    Please be advised that I, as your Memory Center
                    provider, do NOT have the authority to grant you
                    driving privileges, nor to speed up the review
                    process; only the DMV has that authority.
                    After a report has been filled with the Department
                    of Public Health, they notify the DMV who will send
                    paperwork to you to fill out. The DMV may suspend
                    your license until they have further information
                    about your condition.
                    What to do with the paperwork sent by the DMV to you:
                    --You should complete your portion including your
                    medical record number, sign in the appropriate
                    places on the first page, and do one of the following:
