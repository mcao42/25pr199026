Hi Ally,
I have a very bad news
My husband had a very bad stroke a month ago
His condition is getting worse and no hope to improved
He  has been in an assisting living nursing care
My situation is I need time to recover myself  at Maui If he passed 
away, but i do now know when?
I have to make decision  very soon , because my reservation is the prime 
time in Hawaii
Please go ahead and take new applications for my occupancy
I will check with you again if my situation changes
If i can not make my dream comes true this time, will check with you 
again for another period
Thank you for your time
