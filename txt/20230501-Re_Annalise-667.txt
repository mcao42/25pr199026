On #2, if he runs out of resources, isn't he eligible for Medicaid for 
assisted living?

    Nope, I didn't talk to Dad at all about any restraining order on his

    This is the million dollar question.  As I see it, here's the menu.

    1. If he is making his own decisions, his incompetence (and
    anti-social tendencies) will keep getting him in trouble and
    misery.  But this is the category he wants to stay in.

    2. If a public guardian makes Dad's decisions, his resources will be
    drained fast (including his use of a lawyer) and he will be mad at
    the public guardian and his lawyer.

    3. If we make decisions for him (forced through a conservatorship,
    since voluntary modification of his Living Will is not viable), the
    advantages are saving of his resources as well as less misery.  But
    the disadvantage is that he will act up a lot against us.

    Personally, I am willing to do #3 only if he asks for help.  Then
    that will reduce his acting up, but I'm sure it will still be there.

        My take aways from your emails:

        1) Dad’s greed for money from A. seems to blind his judgment
        completely.

        2) Dad doesn’t seem to care about his health in any way.  He
        knows his poor diet is a major contributor of his diabetes and
        other chronic conditions but isn’t making any effort.  His meds
        won’t do him much good if he has nothing under control.

        3) I’m wondering…if Dad doesn’t care nor wants our help, why
        should we go through all this trouble?

        FYI, I’m on travel this week, but will check texts and emails.

            I explained things a bit out of order.  Here's the
            chronology of Saturday:

            * I came to the house around 9:30 AM, but nobody was up. 
            Finally around 10 AM, people started milling about.

            * Around 10:30 AM, the three of us (including Dad and
            Annalise) went to a locksmith to make a backup car key for Dad.

            * _Major event #1, talking with Annalise and Dad._  Then, we
            had breakfast at a Pho joint around 11:30 AM.

            * We came back to Chipper around 1 PM.  Dad and I ditched
            Annalise so we could talk privately (we headed back to the
            locksmith).  Her constant chattering had been very annoying.

            * We left her alone at the house for maybe around 30
            minutes.  Being "alone with Ken," she got very annoyed with
            Dad and apparently that's when both she and Ken called the
            police on each other.  It was something about the cats, I guess.

            * _Major event #2, the talk with the police around 2:15
            PM._  This was described in my other email.

            * _Major event #3, talking with Dad separately (Luxe Buffet
            at Westminster Mall)._  Basically I already summarized this
            in another email.  BTW, his diet is completely uncontrolled
            again.  He has no problem wolfing down tons of carbs.  And
            he insisted on eating at a buffet, just 3 hours after he
            already had breakfast.  He claims he is still on his meds

            So, I'll describe Major event #1 (Annalise) as that's the
            only major topic not covered.  Think of this in terms of
            understanding Dad's psychology, since we aren't interested
            in her mental illness per se.
            --------------------------------
            The three of us were having a pho brunch.  I warmed Dad up
            around 15 minutes before finally talking about the public
            guardianship.  I did not disclose to him that I knew about
            the Deputy Public Guardian business card left on his door. 
            I asked him if they contacted him yet, he said no.  I asked
            him if he knew Michelle's plan to recommend a public
            guardian and 24-hour care for him, he said no.  Basically,
            almost everything I said came as a surprise to him.  He was
            mostly silent in response, although he did show some initial
            emotion (anger).

            Annalise mostly either did not understand or completely
            misheard what I was telling Dad.  Everything I said, she
            responded with some completely irrelevant anecdote from her
            life.  Since she was so focused on herself, at one point, I
            asked her why she no longer owns a home.  She never
            responded to the question, but she started saying that she
            and her husband used to own several homes.  And then he got
            into a cocaine habit and got in trouble with the
            authorities.  Maybe she was hinting at their losing their
            property because of his drug crimes.

            She kept trying to talk about her latest restraining order
            request against Ken, which apparently was filed days ago.  I
            asked her what was the basis of it.  She didn't understand
            the question, I guess, so she said he stole $150 from her
            this morning.  Well, this was a surprise, since I was in the
            house since the time she woke up.  I looked over at Dad, and
            he smiled and said nothing.  (I read this as, he knows she
            is a nut but doesn't care.)

            Annalise had gotten a retired lawyer, Mary, fresh from Texas
            (no California attorney license) to help her with her latest
            RO.  She said she loved getting the help from a
            "powerhouse," but she didn't understand everything else the
            lawyer was asking her to do.  She also did not like that
            Mary told her she needs to be in court to back up her
            accusations.

            I asked Annalise if she intended to move up to NoCal with
            Dad.  She said she'd be inclined to, but that she wants to
            visit first, perhaps by a train trip.  Dad said she gets
            $3,500+ in social security, perhaps Mark could rent out a
            room to her.  So basically that is their thinking, that they
            want to be near each other.

            Annalise being there was a big problem because Dad and I
            couldn't hear ourselves thinking with all her chattering. He
            initially accepted my framing of the issue, as public
            guardian vs. a family-based POA.  He aimed most of his
            displeasure at Michelle, and he hinted he thought Mom might
            be involved, because of Michelle mentioning she knew our
            family (i.e., social workers in a personal network).  He
            asked me how Michelle got involved.  I said I didn't know,
            but maybe neighbors reported problems to the social agency.

            My conclusion regarding Annalise is that Dad is acutely
            conscious of her big social-security check.  They don't
            connect mentally at all, and in fact are annoyed with each
            other most of the time.  He was silent most of the time when
            she was chattering.  One possibility is that he is fairly
            calculating about using her, even with her jumbled mental
            functioning.

            When his displeasure regarding 'public guardian' was aimed
            at Michelle, he accepted my framing of the issue.  But as I
            shifted the focus more on accelerating a POA agreement, he
            got defensive and started making demands:  a detailed plan
            was needed from Hanh, the POA needed to remain revocable, etc.

            In summary, all of this confirms:  (1) Dad and Annalise find
            each other useful.  (2) Dad does want to keep Annalise
            around long-term.
