Michelle,

Hopefully you'll have no problem accessing this folder, which contains 
five photos (more to be uploaded) showing the interior of my father's house.

There appear to be small insects (fruit flies?) hovering over the 
kitchen trash.  The kitchen floor looks like it has not been mopped in a 
decade.  On the tables and counters, things pile up, so there is not a 
normal empty area for eating.  Hallways and walkways are lined with 
boxes and furniture, making walking around hard to do.  The clutter gets 
worse with each visit.

The absolutely worst thing is the strong bio odor.  I do not know what 
it is ... dead bugs/rats?  Feces? :-(
