Hi Maria,

A couple of things:

First, I am mailing to you the house lease renewal, on behalf of my 
mother.  When you receive it, you'll see that the lease paper was 
duplicated.  Just keep one copy for yourself.  For the second copy, 
please sign and send back to my mother in the provided envelope.

Second, would you please take over responsibility for trash pickup 
payments, as agreed to between Thanh and yourself?  My mother says the 
amount should be around $84 per quarter.  Thanh has paid the bill 
through May 21, 2023.

To pay after May 21, 2023, Thanh advises that you setup for automatic 
payments, to avoid any lapses.  You can do so by calling Republic 
Services at (714) 575-3845.  You can give them either the Crosby address 
or the parcel number, 099-022-08, to setup an account.  Of course, 
please make sure they delete my Mom's account while doing so.

If you have any questions, please let me know at the phone number below, 
either by text or phone call.

Best regards,
Mark
