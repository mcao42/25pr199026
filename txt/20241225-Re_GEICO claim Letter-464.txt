I'm not really sure why there's no collision coverage. I will print the 
policy.  It is best that you take over her car coverage in the future. 
It is also best that she not drive the Corolla until it is covered 
differently.

Both Mom and Hang are bad drivers. I did not omit collision coverage 
intentionally.

    Mom talked to Geico yesteday. This confirms what Mom said all along
    that it was NOT her fault.

    But there are so many questions this letter raised about the kind of
    decisions and action made on her behalf with full trust to take care
    of her. Why did mom not have collision insurance? How was that
    decision made? Was there an explanation to her last Oct about what
    was set up? What if she had been badly injured? How much was "saved"
    compared to all the costs and suffering she's going through now?

    We will get quotes for more adequate coverage.
