Hi Mom,

While I visited Dad today, I started a video call with Samantha so she 
could say hello to Dad.

Dad was quiet throughout the call, although he did wave hello to her.  
Samantha gave an update about where she's at and what she has been 
doing.  She talked about her management work with Montessori schools, 
and she also mentioned that she will likely visit California soon.  If 
that pans out, she will get to visit Dad in person.
