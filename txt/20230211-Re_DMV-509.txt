Yes, Julian Cummings does the same kind of thing, advertising the 
prostitutes he visits.  And he doesn't even have cognitive decline.

    it can provide a more focused light for him to see.

    When he comes to your place, Huy, watch out for use of his laptop in
    front of your children.

        Dad needs his other laptop and his iPad. He can use them for his
        video visits.

        The laptop he has with him is mostly used by him to watch porn.

        You need to verify that he has those items before leaving HB.

                Hanh - I remembered what you asked me to help with - the
                DMV response.  Below is the excerpt regarding the DMV in
                Dr. Datta’s message.  It predicated on the assumption
                that dad has a valid drivers license.  I don’t think he
                does.  If he truly doesn’t, I’m not sure that there’s a
                lot of do in response.

                Regarding Department of Motor Vehicle (DMV) reporting;
                California state law requires me to send a form to the
                Department of Public Health if there is a concern
                regarding safety while driving. They notify the
                Department of Motor Vehicles. I have no choice in this
                matter.
                 From the DMV: 'Driving is an activity that uses a
                number of cognitive skills
                <https://hswprodnbm.appl.kp.org/portal/dmv/?1dmy&urile=wcm:path:/dmv_content_en/dmv/about/senior/health/exercise> in
                a complex manner. These cognitive skills include memory,
                visual processing, attention, and the ability to analyze
                driving-related situations to make appropriate
                decisions. Medical conditions and medications common to
                seniors have an impact on cognitive abilities.
                Your muscle strength, endurance, flexibility, and muscle
                reaction to stimuli are all necessary for operating your
                vehicle and for turning your head to view traffic.
                Age-related physical changes and musculoskeletal
                diseases (such as arthritis) may affect your ability to
                drive safely and comfortably.'
                Please be advised that I, as your Memory Center
                provider, do NOT have the authority to grant you driving
                privileges, nor to speed up the review process; only the
                DMV has that authority.
                After a report has been filled with the Department of
                Public Health, they notify the DMV who will send
                paperwork to you to fill out. The DMV may suspend your
                license until they have further information about your
                condition.
                What to do with the paperwork sent by the DMV to you:
                --You should complete your portion including your
                medical record number, sign in the appropriate places on
                the first page, and do one of the following:
