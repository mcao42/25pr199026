Hanh called me a liar about this topic. Hanh, your words speak for 
yourself.  See the screenshots below.

And Ms. Huynh: I used to feel sorry for you for being stuck with Elena 
and Hanh to care for you. But after everything you're doing to Dad right 
now, you deserve them at the time in life when you will become helpless.

Sincerely,
Huy
