I cannot thank you enough for the excellent trip you helped us make 
moving my mother to Florida. From the moment we decided on your company, 
making the reservation and the ultimate kindness of everyone involved, 
made this a good experience. From those in the office keeping us 
informed as we went to Jan our transport nurse who texted us and kept us 
up to date on details and shared stories with us along our route. She 
took excellent care of my mom and that security went a long way. To our 
drivers Sean & Manuel, who kept us laughing every moment and would 
always ask if we needed anything at all. Their calmness and efficiency 
made us feel safe. My family cannot thank you enough. I would recommend 
you to anyone who needed your services. Thank you!

The Medlink staff from coordinators to the crew had all the answers. 
They gained my confidence that my mother would be moved to her new home 
over 500 miles safely. Then they accomplished this by coming through.

Drivers Damon and Kelon were efficient, courteous, helpful, 
accommodating, respectful and all around very nice. The Nurse, Linda, 
was so helpful, friendly, knowledgeable, efficient and understanding of 
my daughters needs and wants. She did her job so well and made a very 
long and difficult trip for my daughter and myself as easy and 
comfortable as possible.
