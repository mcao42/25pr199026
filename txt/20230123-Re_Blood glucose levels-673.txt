    Here are some of the guidelines I used in interpreting my own
    glucose readings.

    1. The more informative readings are two hours after finishing a
    meal; refer to the 2nd-to-last column below.  If Dad is making
    progress and becoming increasingly insulin sensitive, his reading
    should get under 200.

    Glucose Level Reference 			
    (mg/dL) 	After fasting 	1-2 hrs aft meal 	2 hrs aft meal 	2-3 hrs
    aft meal
    Normal 	70-99 	< 140 	< 139 	< 100
    Prediabetes 	100-125 		140-199 	
    Type 1/2 Diabetes 	> 126 		> 200 	


    2. Individual readings can be off as much as +- 10.  So, the trend
    after several days is what matters.  For this reason, the readings
    should be logged in Excel.

    3. Compare "like" readings to each other, not with "differing"
    readings.  E.g., compare morning readings to morning readings, and
    2-hours-after-meal readings to each other.

    4. Be careful about morning readings, due to the "dawn phenomenon"
    in which blood glucose is naturally high due to circadian rhythm,
    getting the body ready for the day.
