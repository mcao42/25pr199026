Yes, it sounds like a mess.  I don't know how Dad thought he could 
handle all of this on his own.  Lost his car, Ken's still there going 
bonkers, and Analisa is in charge.

What is 5051?

    Hi Hanh,

    More of a mess happening in HB.

    So, looks like Ken can't handle the stress.  He has been the only
    person contacting me, so all the news is coming from him.  (Jeff
    won't reply to me, nor does Dad.  And, I don't bother contacting
    Annalise anymore.)

    * Dad went ahead with the request for restraining order against Ken,
    but the judge denied it.  I have no idea if they started a new
    restraining order, or continued the old one that I tried
    unsuccessfully to terminate.

    * In mid-March, Dad says he cancelled the 60-day eviction that I
    started on March 14th.  Yet, Ken is confused about whether the
    eviction is still going on.  Dad seems very confused about it.  He
    is still accepting rent from Ken, even though he seems to now want
    that eviction to go forward.

    * Ken says Annalise is basically running the house (playing dad like
    a fiddle) and is making life hell for him (Ken).  He definitely
    wants to move out, but it seems he doesn't have the money and is
    basically begging me for money.

    * Police have been called to the house many times by Ken.  He claims
    the police know Annalise is crazy, but they seem to consider all
    this a civil matter.

    * I asked Ken to verify that Dad's dark gray Corolla got dented in. 
    He says hadn't noticed, but when he checked the driveway, he didn't
    see that car.  So, there are three possibilities: (1) The accident
    was made up by Dad's relative.  (2) The car got impounded after the
    accident.  (3) Dad is getting the car fixed.

    To me, the most important thing is whether the police are going to
    do something about Dad (5150).  If something doesn't happen soon, I
    could see the situation getting out of control.

    Huy
