    Thc for the recap. What's clear is that it's hard to undo years of
    neglect.  Dad's smart and knowlingly went down the path he did.

        * Doc mentioned about how Dad didn't do any visits for about 3
        years, and that his non-compliance contributed to his blood
        sugar getting out of control.

        * Regarding the stroke, I told the doc about Dad's recent
        improvements.
            - Speech much easier to understand.  Eating is much more
        normal, with no coughing and being able to eat Vietnamese chao.
            - right leg also seeing significant improvement, with
        flexing now doable.
            - he has always been able to listen and understand and
        doesn't seem to have aphasia.
            - right arm still completely limp.
            - He has gotten a bit more feisty (cantankerous) since he
        became stronger.

        * The doc and I discussed Dad moving to another B&C in Northern
        California.  Doc is totally fine with this and thinks it's
        better for Dad to be near family.

        * He thinks SoCal and NoCal KP are not "stoved piped" and are
        fairly seamless in transferring services.  So if the patient has
        therapy benefits, they should transfer to the new location.

        * I mentioned we're considering professional non-emergency
        medical transport, but he believes that is not necessary for
        Dad's case.

        * He says one of the main concerns about Dad remains kidney
        function.  Metformin can adversely affect kidney function, and
        for that reason, was discontinued.
