        Dear Karina,____

        __ __

        I am Ho Van Cao's daughter.  I am writing on behalf of my father
        who has been facing some serious health issues.  He is staying
        with me in the Bay Area to get better and will have difficulty
        making it to LA on 2/20 for the 1:1 appointment with you.  I
        understand also that you have an examination scheduled with him
        on 2/23.  Can you provide more details?  Is it possible for this
        to occur in the Bay Area?____

        __ __

        Can we do the 2/20 meeting by zoom?  I can help him set this up.____

        __ __

        If absolutely needed, I have a business trip to LA the week of
        March 6 and can bring my father.____

        __ __

        Attached is a legal document that designates me and my brothers
        with power of attorney.____
