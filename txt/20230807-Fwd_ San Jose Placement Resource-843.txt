The placement person recommended to me two places with good reputations 
in Union City. She says there's no place in Fremont that she can recommend.

Hi Mark,
Absolutely not too early to look. In fact, it's advised you secure a 
room prior to discharge. Give me a call when you are free to chat 
(925)495-0330. Our Senior Living Advisors answer the phones until 8 
o'clock.

Hi Christine,

I was recommended to you for my father who is recovering from an acute 
stroke.

I would like for him to be placed to a new B&C, preferably in Fremont, 
starting around Sunday, September 10th. Is it too early to start looking?

Mark
