1. Transportation.
Free tickets for Southwest would be good!  They have good "meet and 
greet" services for wheelchair, which is what Dad will need.

2. Living.
Looking at a large community now at Santana Row called Bemont.  Around 
130 residents, even includes 24-hour nursing (which most assisted living 
places don't have).  Has on-site therapy, PT, OT and ST, but they say 
Kaiser doesn't pay for it, so the sessions would be out of pocket.  A 
studio there runs for around $6K/month.

The Yelp reviews are fine, tending to be higher than average for this 
kind of facility.  But there are some negative reviews that are from 
several years ago.  I am not sure that there are any perfect places out 
there.  There's one spot called Caring Hearts that has good reviews, but 
their availability is limited, with only 12 residents.

The Belmont community would be good for good for me, as it's on my way 
to work and back home.  I figure I'll visit Dad 5-6 times per week, so 
physical location could be important.

We could also look to Fremont and Union City as well, but that depends 
how often you plan to visit him.  Thoughts on that?

    I’m curious what you’ll find in terms of fit with Dad’s needs for
    24/7 assisted care.

    How does air transport work?

    Btw, I have a lot of points on SWA.  Can use for you and him to travel.

        Fyi, I'm going to start checking these out to see if she's
        providing a quality list.

        And regarding transportation, I'm thinking air transport is
        going to be the safest and most comfortable.
