        Hi Hanh,

        Michelle called me today.  Let me try to capture what she said,
        for both of our notes.  Her work number (cell phone?) is (714)
        815-1441.

        She has known about dad for "a while," but she mentioned hardly
        any details beyond that.  Generally she was not impressed by
        Dad.  Dad had tried to portray himself as a big shot in Vietnam
        (in a high government position), but Michelle replied to him, "I
        respect what you were then, but just look at how you are living
        now."

        Her observation of his living conditions:  Dad had not allowed
        her in the house before.  But there was one time that she
        stopped by, and he was nowhere to be found.  Then Annalise let
        Michelle in the house to try to find Dad.  She then was able to
        observe the squalor inside as well as in the backyard -- not
        sure if she took pictures, but I believe she wouldn't be allowed
        to.  (I think Michelle was trying to say that only Dad can allow
        her access to info about Dad; so her only chance to observe the
        property was via Annalise helping her to look for Dad.)

        Dad had said to her that his life is fine, saying that he was
        free and clear of the mortgage.  I corrected this point later
        for her, letting her know that the house originally cost less
        than $100K, but Dad now owes more than $400K.  This probably
        startled her, suggesting to her that he is financially
        desperate, not financially independent as she had thought.

        Dad at one point told her that he will sell the house (I suspect
        he told her so very recently).  Michelle then said, "Why don't
        you involve your children to help you?  You know that
        real-estate agents can be scammers."  So he tried telling her
        all our names and cities.  The only one correct was "Cao Thanh
        Huy, San Jose."  She got both your name and Hien's wrong, as
        well as the cities.  I suspect that even my name/city were said
        wrong by Dad, but that she must have corrected those facts in
        her notes once she got my APS report.  She said Dad refused to
        give out our phone numbers.  She was genuinely glad that I filed
        the APS report on 4/12 so that she finally had a way of
        contacting us.

        She did not know about all the car accidents (the one several
        years ago, around the same time his health significantly
        deteriorated) as well as all the dents in his "new" car now. 
        So, I told her about those accidents.  I suggested to her that
        he could have a financial incentive for getting into accidents.

        We also talked briefly about Annalise.  But Michelle didn't want
        to get sidetracked on that, saying that Annalise "has her own
        case worker."

        I tried to emphasize Dad's driving with only a senior ID (issued
        2018) and suspended driver license (Feb 2023).  Michelle didn't
        know about this.  She said she did know about him still
        driving.  When I told her I was thinking of tracking Dad with a
        GPS device to be able to report him driving without a DL to the
        police, she implicitly encouraged me to do so, because that's an
        action she cannot take.

        Two other important points were discussed.

        (1) She was young when she started her career with County of
        Orange, at the same time Mom was retiring.  In her recollection,
        Mom retired in the late 1990s.  Around that time (or after?),
        Mom had volunteered to do flowers for Michelle's wedding (but I
        guess she didn't take Mom up on that offer).  it seems that they
        both worked for OC's in-home supportive services.

        (2) I hinted that I thought Dad had a mental disorder before he
        started getting old.  She took that prompt and asked what that
        might be, which is when I told her why I thought he might have
        Borderline Personality Disorder.  And this is when I mentioned
        about wife abuse.  I also mentioned Dad's paranoia tendencies.

        She suggested a couple of ways of advancing the case:  (1) a
        meeting with all the children, and (2) next week, we (the
        siblings) meet with her and Dad at Dad's house.

        #1 - This is my action, to arrange a meeting with us and her. 
        This is for her to gather more input/info.  And I presume that
        she wants us to think about filing for a conservatorship.

        #2 - Initially I agreed to a tentative plan that I would meet
        her at Dad's house on Thursday, 4/20 at 10 AM.  However, this
        will be consequential, so we should discuss this further when we
        meet with her.  Michelle's idea is that, with us there, Dad will
        let her into the house, and with his being surprised, the
        discussion could go in a different direction.

        Lastly, regarding info that was *not* discussed:

        * There's no way for her to know the extent of his poor physical
        condition (falling often, bad legs, daytime sleepiness).

        * She repeated the often-heard theme that APS relies on
        voluntary cooperation of the client.  I believe this means she
        is not really an investigator (for example, maybe she can't even
        take photos??), but rather she depends on info provided to her.
