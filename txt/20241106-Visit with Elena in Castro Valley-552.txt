Hi Mom,

I went to Castro Valley today after work to check out the assisted 
living facility. The positives about it include that Elena appears to be 
nice on a first impression, and her home was clean at the time I visited.

Weighing advantages and disadvantages of moving Dad, I do not see any 
advantages for him of this new home; and I see some disadvantages. 
Because of that, it is best for him to stay at his current residence.

Thanks,
Huy
