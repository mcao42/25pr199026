Dear Hanh & Jeff,

Thank you for your well wishes for Lisa and Gerardo.  We are sorry you 
cannot make it to Temecula!
But we will see Hanh, your Mom and  Di 7 in Dallas to attend Ri Anh's 
daughter birthday party, and then the Cancun trip.
I already asked Ri Anh to book the same hotel for us two in Cancun 
and are in the process to book the air tickets.
What are your planned activities on 5/19 and 5/21 in Dallas, and 4 days 
in Cancun?  We plan to join you, your Mom & Di 7 and Ri Anh's family for 
our big family reunion if possible.

Best,
Di 8

Congratulations on Lisa and Gerado's upcoming wedding!  ðŸ¥‚

Thank you for the invitation to the wedding. Unfortunately, we are not 
able to make it but would like to wish Lisa and her fiance happiness in 
their lifetime union.

Hanh and Jeff

    Hi Di 8,

    FYI, I have RSVPed for both Mom and myself.  I let Lisa and Gerardo
    know that we cannot attend the wedding reception (but that we do
    plan to attend the engagement).

    Best regards,
    Chieu
