Hi Hanh HangHuy,

    I have been feeding very heathy and special foods by di My such as
    heart of palm salads, duck. Chicken, charcoal grilled shrimp and
    barbecue pork, fine pandan rice noodle and    varieties of    
    tropical fruits, vu sua, sa  bo che, papaya, dua gang , mang cau
    xiem thanh long…and grapefruits from her farm .i learned  from her
    and a good MD that even though i use cholesterol meds, it still ok
    to. eat grapefruits 4-8 hours away from my meals.
    I had spent a lot of time recording my zumba exercise sessions  in
    my City Sport club classes , but i could not play themon the tivi
    without converting to video form
    If Jackie has time please put  them in video link and send them to me
    I have walked about 30’ in the morning on country roads, abour 30’
    after dinner then do zumba dance Besame Mouchu with the Golden Zumba
    dace group . Di My could play video episodes on Tivi for me
    She insisted mixing warm water for my night shower Otherwise i love
    city water for my shower . It is well sterilized,  as clear and
    clean as our water
    She sometimes took me on her Honda to Bentre annd Mytho markets to
    buy or fix  things
    I mostly spent my time  at her country home
    She has an air conditioner in my room
    I turn it on in the afternoon or when i dance zumba. Mostly i use
    fans. She has fan everywhere in her house, just like mine!
    I really  enjoyed the warm love and care of her family. Long,  her 
    husband always helps me  with heavy lifting, Khuong and Be Nhu help 
    me with computer things . Khuong and Tuyen always find some very
    special fruits and foods for me
    I feel very welcome in these  loving  and caring relatives
    Be Nhu is now a very  charming and pretty young  lady, still she is
    a traditional reserved Vietnamese girl . She is good in English and
    Japanese languages and having 2 jobs in Saigon, one in Human
    relation department for a company and a gym instructor as a second job
    Khuong and Tuyen have 2 children about 10 and 5 years old
    Khuong  is a lawyer . He is  Vice President of a government agency
    and having a part time teaching job at Tien Giang  public university
    I showed to  di My the picture of the keepsake for ashes of dad and
    me that  she will keep in her family cemetery
    i will  plan a five day  trip on a trans-Vietnam modern  train for
    sight seeing with Be Nhu
    That is all for now!
    Hope that Dad is still fighting for his life until i come back
    I will bring heart of palm salads and pandan fine rice noodle and
    fresh bamboo shoots  fir you

        Dad seems a bit weaker to me, but I believe he'll survive. :-)
        Please enjoy your time traveling and do not worry so much about Dad.

        Nice photos!
