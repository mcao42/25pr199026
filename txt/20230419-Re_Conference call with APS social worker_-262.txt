Still haven't heard back from Hanh.  Michelle's schedule for Thursday is 
filling up, so let's try to block off 30 minutes to talk to her.

She called me today, describing her encounter with Dad today.

1. Dad said to her, "I need Mark's help to kick out Ken."

2. Michelle said Dad looked pitiful (appearance and dubious behavior).  
I told her we've seen much worse from him.

3. I told her we have decided on pursuing a conservatorship.  She said 
that she will have to recommend a public guardianship.  So I asked her 
what does that mean?  That he will first be under a public guardianship, 
but then that can be "converted" to a conservatorship?  She said no, 
that's not what she means at all.  She said that we need to act very 
fast on the conservatorship.

4. She will be emailing me a list of OC elder attorneys.

A public guardianship, if permanent, is very negative because he is not 
only losing his freedom, but his assets are being used for his 
involuntary care.  That's my understanding of what Michelle meant, but 
we can get clarification from her on Thursday.

        Hien and Hanh,

        I spoke again to Michelle Nguyen, the Adult Protective Services
        social worker.  She reiterated that she wanted to do a
        conference call with all of us.

        1. I am guessing that Thursday would be the best day to book
        something.  My schedule is flexible, so I just need to know what
        would work for both of you.

        And when talking to her:

        2. We should offer her documentation, as it seems
        her investigative scope is limited.

        3. IMO, we should let her know our intention of suing for
        conservatorship.  This then should put her in a mode of thinking
        of (a) supporting it, (2) giving helpful tips (perhaps even
        attorney names), and (3) sharing her experience of when a
        conservatorship makes the most sense.

        Thanks,
        Huy
