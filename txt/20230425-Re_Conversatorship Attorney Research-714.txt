    Huy,

    I was fine looking up reviews of those on Michelle's list.

    Initial criteria:  I was inclined to NOT select lawyers in posh
    towns like Newport Beach and Laguna HIlls (high overhead).  I ended
    up looking up those in Santa Ana and Orange.

    I selected 3 with top ratings/reviews (saved in the
    DAD/conservatorship/attorneys director in this Attorney Research
    <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rcxZZOz6-Wj7qCAZItZ1udxVit-bKu--DEjuGtndaig/edit#gid=0>google
    doc.

    Interestingly, I looked up the lawyer that Dad chose for his will &
    trust.  It turns out that James Roberts was also on Michelle's
    list.  I found this law firm really nice when Dad had me go through
    the Zoom family day to learn about how a will & trust works.  He
    might be amenable to using someone he trusts.

    I noticed that if we go through the avvo.com <http://avvo.com> site,
    we can message the law firm to set up a consultation.  We might do
    that rather than call for efficiency.
