        Mom,

        I just talked to Westminster Memorial Park.

        All burial contracts are either already under your name, or
        under your name and Dad's jointly, with you having right of
        survivorship. So, there is no hurry to sell them. After Dad
        passes away, you still have all rights to those properties to sell.

            Hi Mom,

            Here's the info.

            Company:  American Memorial Life Insurance, *(800) 533-2220.*
            Contract #:  6-489783 (Ho V Cao)
            Contract #:  6-489784 (Thanh X Huynh)
            Benefit _per_ contract:  $9,347.  Cash value:  $7,410.
            For prearrangement with:  Peek Family Funeral Home, 7801
            Bolsa Ave, Westminster, CA 92683.

            I would call the life insurance company at the 800 number
            above. Just let them know you no longer live in Westminster,
            and that you are planning to sell all your cemetery and
            funeral contracts.  Then ask them whether the two
            prearranged funeral contracts can be transferred to a buyer.
