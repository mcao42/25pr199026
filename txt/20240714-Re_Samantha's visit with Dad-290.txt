    Hi Mom,

    While I visited Dad today, I started a video call with Samantha so
    she could say hello to Dad.

    Dad was quiet throughout the call, although he did wave hello to
    her.  Samantha gave an update about where she's at and what she has
    been doing.  She talked about her management work with Montessori
    schools, and she also mentioned that she will likely visit
    California soon.  If that pans out, she will get to visit Dad in person.
