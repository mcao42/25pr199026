I'd like to be taken off the list as Dad's beneficiary and primary 
trustee. I had assumed that you've taken on that role, Huy because of 
the power of attorney.

I don't want to speak for Hien. He can let you know himself, his 
preference.

All I meant to say was I prefer for you to be the beneficiary since 
you've been doing all of the work to take care of Dad.

    After months of preparation of Dad's docs and finances, in which I
    kept you in the loop, Hanh texted to me several days ago.  It must
    have taken Hanh several seconds to do this.  She texted her
    preference to have Hanh and Hien be removed as any kind of
    beneficiary for Dad's assets (I can provide a screenshot if that is
    needed).

    As I stated before, any kind of decision like this is fine with me. 
    It's equitable.  Mom will be subtracting from or outright removing
    anybody favored by Dad to assure equity.  And this is fine with me
    to have Mom opposing what I am doing for my parent.  I absolutely
    cannot do the right thing for my aging parent if Mom imposes her
    conditions on how I help my parent.

    Please, know that it takes significant resources, the most valuable
    of which is time, to do these things.  But it seems worthwhile to do
    Dad's documents once to get it right.  If you are unwilling to be:

    * his trustee (someone he can rely on)
    * his beneficiary

    then please let me know now so I can help redo his documents, just
    one more time.

    There is a lot of urgency to these tasks because of (1) his age and
    (2) things like his $250K settlement for which his lawyer does not
    seem to be in any hurry to close.  Therefore beneficiary assignments
    are needed.

    Thanks,

    Huy
