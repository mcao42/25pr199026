Hien,

Dad signed the "Release of All Claims" today.  Some details of what Dad 
will get.

* 250K (gross)
- minus 45% lawyer's fee on the gross
- minus court related costs
- minus medical expenses

I recommended to Dad a structured settlement (annuity) rather than a 
lump sum.  Dad will be designating you as the sole beneficiary as soon 
as that is allowed, so that you wouldn't have to go to probate court.
