I have to be in San Jose on Tuesday, but Hang can assist with the 
transfer to long-term home care.

    Hi,

    Ms. Jeong, Dad's case worker, called. Based on the improved lab test
    results for Dad's kidney, Doctor Pelligrino plans to discharge Dad
    next Tuesday. Cherise Pratti will arrange transportation which
    family pays (~$200). All medical equipment have been ordered from
    Kaiser and set up at B&C, incl hospital bed ($25/mo), wheelchair
    ($25/mo rental), commode for shower and toilet ($25). Dad is
    responsible for 10% copay.
