Mom,

I want to double check... Did you tell Dad Friday or Saturday morning? I 
have 12/24, (Saturday) on my calendar to pick him up.

Also, what does this mean?  "When i talked to him 2 days
I did tell him that h will come pnnfiofaßddddd me"

H.

    I found the email i sent to dad in octobet about the swa from long
    beach to oakland
    Dad had more than 4 email sddresses and he got confused
    Twodays ago dad called and  asked me about the upcoming trip
    I told him from Friday-morning to monday morning by swa
    He repeated what i said . I think  that he remembers
    I usually check in online for him
    We  can still Cancel the trip a few hours before the  flight
    I will try to call him again and again
