Going through his papers, I found at least half a dozen legal actions.  
One was against him (probably just a traffic violation?) while the rest 
were him against others, mostly self-represented.  Several were CA and 
against tenants, while at least a couple were federal.

I started several lawsuits for him, the most important being the 
$60,000 + interest + attorney fees
claim against his niece Jessica.  (Her husband died in the last month.  
His hospitalization was one of her excuses for refusing to repay him.)  
The one against Jessica is under my name as plaintiff, to make Jessica 
take it more seriously.

I have copies of the $20,000 personal check and the $40,000 bank check 
payable to Jessica, along with the mortgage gift letter.  Other than 
that, all the details appear to be verbal. *If you are aware of any 
documentation, please let me know (I doubt the recorded phone call can 
be used).*  I searched hard through his emails but found nothing.  And 
Dad is sure he didn't text anything to her.  Researching legal 
principles, I'd say Dad's chances of winning are 75%, based on something 
called 'resulting trust' and the fact that the transfer was large 
(therefore a strong assumption under California law it was a loan), and 
also based on the mortgage gift letter not being in the form of a proper 
gift contract.

Dad also wants to sue Chu Vui, which I'm not that thrilled about, 
knowing the background there.  I am encouraging him to focus on 
Jessica.  But he does have a lot of leverage against Chu Vui, so that 
might be useful.  I am going to make it very clear to all these people 
that any lawsuit will survive past Dad's death.

Thanks
