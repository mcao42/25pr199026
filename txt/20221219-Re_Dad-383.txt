    If dad’s phone is working again, why can’t we call him directly and
    email the flight information to him??????

                    Good lesson learned here.  His traveling doesn't
                    sound like a good idea at all.

                        I'm recovering from Covid, so not 100%, but
                        based on my visit with him in Oct, it's clear
                        that Dad had undergone severe
                        decline--physically and cognitively. He can
                        barely use his iphone or log into his email or
                        other critical accounts. He's confused about his
                        passwords no matter how many times we go through
                        the info.

                        He cannot manage his affairs. He'll need support
                        to keep his house and manage his health. If he
                        refuses, he may end up homeless or incapacitated.

                        That's the conversation we need to have with him.

                        Do you think he understands enough to fly to
                        Oakland, Mom?
