The credit report in the Finance folder shows all of Dad's debts.

I don't know if any assets that I co-own with Dad, including the HSBC acct.

A long time ago, Dad opened small Wells Fargo savings acct for the 
girls. For some reason, he had his name on it  I believe, the accounts 
are closed or he took his name off.

    If you have assets owned jointly with Dad, please be aware that
    those will probably be wiped out upon his death.  The reason being,
    they would *not* have the Trust becoming the active beneficiary
    (rather, the co-owner will be) but they were co-owned by him.

    The only example I've seen is an HSBC account co-owned by Hanh. 
    This account did not have much money in it, but that's beside the point.

    I don't know how much Medicare/Medi-Cal he has used, but it seems he
    has used some.  I also don't know how much much debt he has (perhaps
    not much, with his FICO still being a decent 700).  I will keep his
    major assets out of probate to avoid their "recovery," but I won't
    be able to do that for unknown assets.

    Thanks,
