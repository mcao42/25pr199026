        Hi Michelle,

        Our father's case manager, Sein Jeong, rescheduled him to be
        discharged from The Pavilion at Sunny Hills (Fullerton) on
        Thursday, 7/27 at 11 AM.  I am letting you know (probably
        reddantly), just in case.

        FYI, my sister, Hanh, will be at Sterling to help our father to
        transition to the home.  Would you please let the staff know, as
        needed.

        Best regards,
        Mark
