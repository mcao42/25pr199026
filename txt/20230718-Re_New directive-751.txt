        This looks fine.  Can you upload the signed, notarized version
        into the shared drive?  I've alerted Hien that this is
        happening, not seeking his approval, but I don't expect him to
        protest.

            Attached.  The form isn't the same as the old one, but I
            mapped the content as closely as possible.
