Since dad has new dentures he can eat better, but still have trouble 
swallowing due to his stroke
But Anabelle is back and i am not allowed  to give nutricious 
puree foods to dad at all
  please give hime more lucetna for dinner
He said that coffee in the afternoon keep him awake all night
His mind is a lot better if he can eat good foods
