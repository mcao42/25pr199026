Hi Mom,

FYI, I called Garden Grove City and made sure your business-license 
account is now current (paid).

Unfortunately, they do not have an autopay option.  So, I asked them to 
send bills to Mark Cao in San Jose in the future, not to Chipper Lane.  
I will make sure the bills will not get ignored.
