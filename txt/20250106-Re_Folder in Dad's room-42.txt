Huy,

       Mom tried to take the title transfer material to AAA today to 
file, but they did not accept it since the date had been changed (even 
though initialed).  The DMV site/handbook says errors on the title are 
not accepted, so they gave her REG 252 
(https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/handbook/vehicle-industry-registration-procedures-manual-2/odometer-mileage-reporting/vehicle-vessel-transfer-and-reassignment-form-reg-262/ 
<https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/handbook/vehicle-industry-registration-procedures-manual-2/odometer-mileage-reporting/vehicle-vessel-transfer-and-reassignment-form-reg-262/>) 
to fill out.  This one is not available online since the original is 
required to be filled out on security paper. We filled it out but is 
requires your signature. She would like to mail the form to you today.  
She/we can drop it to the post office if this makes sense.

     The Statement of Facts (form 256) looks ok.

Thanks,

Jeff

    Hanh,

    I left a manila folder on Dad's bed shelf.  It has several items in it.

    - Corolla:

    1. In the folder is the car registration and 2025 sticker.

    2. For transfer, in the folder there is the car title and REG 256
    Statement of Facts. This is being done as a gift, with a tax
    advantage. I recommend you write GIFT in the Price of Sale field on
    the back of the title.

    3. A Bill of Sale is not needed. And there's also another transfer
    related form, but that is a seller-only form, which I am doing
    online today.

    - In the folder is also a business license fee statement Mom needs
    to pay, which is payable by phone. Also, I suggest you change the
    address for future use.

    As for car insurance, as you have added Mom to your insurance, I
    will be taking the Corolla and Accord off the Geico policy today.

    Thanks,
    Huy
