Thanks Huy.  I didn't know that Mom was interested in driving another car?

    Also, I should mention that there is no remaining service contract
    for the Corolla.  Dad bought a two-year contract that has already
    expired.

        Hi Hanh,

        We dropped off the Corolla at Mom's house for her use as long as
        she wants/needs it.  Mainly, it has a rear camera that's a great
        safety feature.

        Here are a few other details so that we together can help Mom to
        use and maintain this car.

        * Navigation:  It does not have a built-in mapping system.  Mom
        simply needs to plug in her iPhone to the lightning cable in the
        car, then use the phone's Maps program.  It takes about 15
        seconds after plugging in the phone for it to "connect" to the
        car, which seems long to me, but otherwise it's easy and
        completely automatic.

        * Maintenance.  The odometer is currently at 8,600 miles and
        just got an oil change using high quality synthetic oil.  So, it
        should not need much maintenance at all till the odometer reads
        28,000 miles.  I think I can help mom with other maintenance as
        needed, such as tire pressure and air filter.

        Huy
