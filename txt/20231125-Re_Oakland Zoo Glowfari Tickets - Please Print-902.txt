    In that case, we should meet you at your home.  I'll put this on our
    calendar.

        Hi Huy and Hang,

        I'm so glad you can join us to see the Animal Light Lantern
        Festival at the Oakland Zoo!

        Attached are your tickets.  Please print.  They admit groups by
        time slots.  If you want to caravan, please meet at our place by
        5p OR meet us at the zoo entrance by 5:20 to go in.  I should
        accompany you to go in.  Not sure how carefully they check
        members' IDs.
