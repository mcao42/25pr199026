Hi Hanh,

Dropping Mom off the CC for this message, since it involves Annalise.

We are probably overthinking this!  I think back to all of Dad's 
reactions and signals, and conclude that Dad wants to stay in HB for two 
main reasons.  First, Annalise is there.  And second, for inertia and 
comfort, because basically he has given up on improving his own health.

He was willing to move up to SJ when he was plotting for Annalise to 
come up here with him.  I remember the one day that I flatly said to him 
that we (Hanh, Hien, Huy) are not responsible for Annalise.  The next 
day, he called me up and said he wanted to return to HB "to die there."

Conclusion:  I think he may go along with the following steps, which 
give him much of what he wants.

* We tell him we're filing for a conservatorship.
    - He can't take care of himself physically.
    - He can't drive but has been driving.
    - He keeps getting into *legal* and financial trouble.
    - We know about all the bad stuff he's done.  (Kind of bluffing 
here, but it plays on his guilty conscience.)

* We tell him we won't exclude Annalise, that is not our intention.  
(This should weaken his will to resist the conservatorship.)

* We tell him our basic plan is to move him to the Bay Area, after 
obtaining the conservatorship, where we can manage an assisted living 
situation for him.

* To obtain a conservatorship, we prep by documenting as much as we can 
of his misdeeds and current poor quality of life.

* Later, in dealing with Annalise (after obtaining conservatorship), I 
think the problem will take care of itself:
    - She might not even want to move here.
    - Both are in poor health.  One or both may pass away soon, etc.
    - The two of them might "break up" soon anyway.
    - We will not flatly break our promise to Dad.  But rather, we 
impose conditions on Annalise.  E.g., she and Dad can live together, but 
she will have to pay half the cost of their assisted-living situation.

The basic idea here is to obtain control, to sell the house, and to move 
Dad here, but basically do it in a way that he himself would have done 
anyway.  So he will not prefer this, but he'll also see benefits in 
having us handle things he can no longer handle.  Ultimately, we have 
decision-making, which will prevent him from doing nasty things.

Mom will not go along with this at all, since it includes Annalise.  I 
think Mom won't see that the intention here is to have Dad see the 
conservatorship as a good thing for him, by which he can still "die 
happy" as he sees it.
