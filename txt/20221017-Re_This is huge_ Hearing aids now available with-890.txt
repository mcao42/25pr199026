Good idea Hanh. Do you know if he will use it?  For some people it’s a 
vanity thing to admit that they need it. I can never tell with him if he 
will or won’t use it.

I don’t know the difference between prescription or nonprescription but 
if we did it we should make sure it works well for him.

    Maybe we can get Dad a hearing aid for Christmas.  I heard that loss

    visiting us from Dec 24-26.
