The truth is somewhere in his email. Hard to say which part is posturing 
because of his eviction and what’s real.

I’m sure he’s doing irrational things. Like I told you yesterday, I was 
in an important meeting yesterday and he called 4 times. I sent his 
calls to voicemail because I had to concentrate. He called right back 
again like it was an emergency. It turns out he was at T~Mobile because 
he wanted a separate account even though I’m paying for his phone. I 
think he wound up getting a new line. I got a message on his Apple 
account asking if I wanted to add a new number for FaceTime calls on the 
iPad I’ve set up as a backup for him. I sent him a text to ask about  he 
actually opened my text but didn’t reply.

Hanh - you’ve done what you can with offering to fly him back. He hasn’t 
opened your emails or texts. He is where he wants to be. We just need to 
be at peace with it.

        Hi Mark, your Dad seems to be exhibiting signs of Alzheimer's.
        Some days he seems okay, but other days he's really out of it!
        That's my observation. Also he brought back that woman,
        Annalise, who your Dad told police several weeks ago that she
        has Dementia. And both last night and tonight she left a burner
        on, on the kitchen stove after she had gone to bed. I discovered
        that when I went into the kitchen around 10PM tonight and about
        the same time last night. She never cleans anything and leaves
        all the pots and pans and dishes dirty. Your Dad used to keep
        everything clean and also clean the kitchen table after he ate,
        but he no longer does that. Elise everything a mess, which he
        did not used to do! Question: Do you have Power of Attorney over
        your Dad? He appears as if he is becoming incompetent and
        Analise's dementia and forgetfulness is becoming a danger to the
        safety of everyone
          here as well as to this property! The shrubs and weeds on the
        side of the house are all overgrown. I would trim it myself but
        your dad has no tools to do that. So again do you have power of
        attorney? Thanks! Ken Van Natta
