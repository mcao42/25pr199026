    Okay, then I will drive the Corolla to you, most likely next
    weekend, November 11th, if you are around. I think it's not a steep
    learning curve. You mainly just have to get used to the feel of a
    new car.

        It is a-good idea
        Dad bought the corolla for me because it has some safety 
        features for older driver and less powerful tha the honda
        But i have to learn how to use it

            Hi Mom,

            What do you think about trading the Corolla for your Honda? 
            You keep the Corolla and we will keep your car for driving
            to/from Orange County.  Then we will trade back, after you
            no longer want to drive anymore.

            The Corolla has some pretty good safety features, like a
            rear-view camera for when you are backing up the car.
