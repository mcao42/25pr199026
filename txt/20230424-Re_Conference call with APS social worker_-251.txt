    I put my notes in the same folder, will combine later today.  It's
    good we heard somewhat different things, then the merge will be more
    complete.

        I created a folder in the shared Dad google drive folder called

            I suggest we compile and combine our notes before coming
            back to Michelle with questions. We'll email that
            communication to Michelle so that we will all be included,
            and we make need to make very good, strategic use of her time.

                                        I spoke again to Michelle
                                        Nguyen, the Adult Protective
                                        Services social worker.  She
                                        reiterated that she wanted to do
                                        a conference call with all of us.

                                        1. I am guessing that Thursday
                                        would be the best day to book
                                        something.  My schedule is
                                        flexible, so I just need to know
                                        what would work for both of you.

                                        And when talking to her:

                                        2. We should offer her
                                        documentation, as it seems
                                        her investigative scope is limited.

                                        3. IMO, we should let her know
                                        our intention of suing for
                                        conservatorship.  This then
                                        should put her in a mode of
                                        thinking of (a) supporting it,
                                        (2) giving helpful tips (perhaps
                                        even attorney names), and (3)
                                        sharing her experience of when a
                                        conservatorship makes the most
                                        sense.

                                        Thanks,
                                        Huy
