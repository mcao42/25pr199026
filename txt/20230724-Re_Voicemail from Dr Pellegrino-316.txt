Ok, did you see the notes on why they took him off the Metformin?

        Dr. Pelligrinos notes are finally entered into Dad's Kaiser
        records today. Much more detailed and helpful relative to his
        VM.  He mentioned twice that Dad wants you to be the primary on
        health care POA. As you have been diligent in following Dad's
        wishes, why don't you just make yourself primary and I can be
        the back up? That will give Dad peace of mind.

            Hi Mark, this is Dr. Pellegrino calling. You don't need to
            call me back. Unless you didn't get the information you need
            from my phone call. Just briefly as you know, I decided he
            could make his own decisions when it's obvious. I'm willing
            to do that and it seemed very obvious on the day I saw him.
            So. Number two. I'm not sure if he's eating enough. A lot of
            patients like this who are borderline. We send them home
            hoping that they'll eat better at a more home environment.
            They perceive as home. So I'm hoping he continues to eat
            better in a couple of weeks. I'm going to want his primary
            doctor to check blood test. So please make sure that gets
            done just to make sure he's not getting dehydrated. I
            literally think of the one in ten chance. He's going to be
            dehydrated every now and then if somebody like this doesn't
            eat. Well we have to admit them to the hospital ...
            I'm hoping they'll be okay. I did blood tests here and
            they're kind of fine. He's got some mild chronic kidney
            disease. So it's hard to tell based on his blood test if
            he's hydrated well or not but he seems to be doing okay. So
            that's about it. I made some adjustments to his medicine. So
            call me if you have any further questions, or if there's
            anything unclear 714-734-5500. Thanks a lot, bye-bye now.
