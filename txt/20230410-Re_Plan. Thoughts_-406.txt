    Given that will know about the report, is there value in Hien
    initiating the contact with the social worker to take action?

        The heater of the housese on oc is not important . I seldom turn
        the geat on!
        Always remember that dad will read your report
        No matter that he is rational or NOT. Until the rest of his llife
        The idea that his dear son  accursed him something that forces
        him out of his house and the life he wants to liive will broke
        his heart until his death. Belive or not, he will take a grudge
        against the reporter
        Let do the way that you are on his side, ignore what is bad he
        did. Let say, you heard what tenants said but you believe in yoi
        dad, you do not live there , you do not see rhings in depth and
        you believe   In what he said and you love him you tried to
        protect him unsuccessfully against those mean people
        I wanted to report, but i worried about the consequence on me
        and indirectly to you
        He or his  relatives will find me up hete to hurt me. They did
        not help him but they want to playRobinhood!, they are criminals
        and they can do any antisocial things

                In my opinion
                Dad will have access to your report
                You only report the situation , let say objective, but
                based on superficial observation and “hearsay”  from
                his  tenant. I think that you do not have to be accurate
                and thorough on the report . You will tell sw  that
                there are a lot of unsolved problems ….
                You stress that you concern about his well being and the
                safety of the household.
                You live in the bay area and only visit him twice a year
                and you can not deal with the situation due to your 
                time constriction  and his non cooperation
                Senior social worker who will  be at the scene will 
                explore and go deeprooted into the problem. That is
                their job to do it
                Do not say anything that is not good for dad’d side, if
                he has to deal with what tenants accused him

                        _*On Monday:*_

                        I'll call Adult Protective Services and tell
                        them my concerns about Dad.

                        /Immediate concerns:
                        /

                        * He regularly drives without a valid driver
                        license.
                            - Recently he has been in several car
                        accidents.  His car is possibly impounded now,
                        following his last accident.

                        * Threats and plots against one of the tenants
                        (Ken).
                            - Unsubstantiated allegations of rape
                        against that tenant, which were part of an
                        eviction attempt that was eventually dropped.

                        * Illegal harassment of one of the tenants, for
                        which Adult Protective Services was called
                        around 4/6.  The harassment included physical
                        assault (grabbing clothes and spitting) and
                        removal of the tenant's refrigerator.

                        * Health hazards:  House and kitchen are very
                        dirty.  Feces all over at least one of the
                        bathrooms.  Bio odor throughout the house.

                        * Fire hazards:  blocked access ways.  Some
                        smoke alarms are not working.

                        * Tenants have not been informed of his mental
                        diagnosis.  Thus they are exposed to a danger of
                        which they are unaware.

                        /Other concerns:/

                        * He is not taking his meds.  He has a diagnosis
                        of dementia and diabetes, but often skips his
                        prescription meds.

                        * Public indecency.  He walks around with his
                        pants dropped below his buttocks.  He has
                        incontinence issues but does not wear adult diapers.

                        * Many police calls to the house (eight in the
                        last three months), some of which are against
                        him for complaints of assault.

                        * Two pet cats in the home, possibly inhumane
                        treatment of them.


                        *_Long-term desire, for County to assist with:_*

                        * Declare incapacitance.
                            - All tenants should be informed, and sign
                        an informed consent form.

                        * Give the family some guidance for how to be
                        granted full conservatorship.
