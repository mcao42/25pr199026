Hi Michelle,

Our father's case manager, Sein Jeong, rescheduled him to be 
discharged from The Pavilion at Sunny Hills (Fullerton) on Thursday, 
7/27 at 11 AM.  I am letting you know (probably redundantly), just in case.

FYI, my sister, Hanh, will be at Sterling to help our father to 
transition to the home.  Would you please let the staff know, as needed.

Best regards,
Mark
