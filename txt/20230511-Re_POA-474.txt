FYI, this is the right form.  It is surprisingly short and is worth a read.

It is used for Limited, General or Durable.

What is the most proper way to write your legal name?

    Thanks.

    We're in a good position to get Dad to sign the Durable POA. I'm
    fine if he gives you the POA, especially since you're doing the TRO/RO.

    Make clear that if he tries to revoke this, Kim/Michele will
    immediately step in.

    Don't waste your whole day.

    Dad know you're coming?

        Hi Hanh,

        How about this.  I go to SoCal with two possible POA forms for
        him to sign.  In order of preference:

        1. Durable POA.  (More powerful than a general POA.)

        2. Limited POA.  In this one, we list specific powers, like
        selling property.  We try to list as many things as possible so
        that it is almost like a General POA.

        What do you think?  This is something that only he has to sign. 
        So, you won't need to do any prep work.  The legal gist of it is
        very similar to the Advance Healthcare Directive, so you could
        look at that again to jog your memory.
