Dear Ms. Huynh:

You have stated that I am no longer your son, and you threatened me with 
legal action on two occasions. Therefore, I am addressing you 
accordingly, out of courtesy.

This letter is to inform you that you are lacking consent when recording 
my family members and me in private settings, including my father in his 
residence. If you need to know the reason, it's because your intention 
for audio and video recordings is not for his welfare or benefit. To the 
contrary, the recordings are selective and biased, and are disruptive to 
the care workers attending to my father.

Until you get another email to the contrary, this email stands as an 
unconditional statement of lack of consent.

Thank you.

Mark
