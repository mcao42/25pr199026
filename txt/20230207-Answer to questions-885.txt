Hien... I just read the doctor's long letter now carefully.  A few Qs: 
1) was a memory med prescribed?

No med was prescribed.

2) could the doctor say anything about how rapidly the dementia will 
progress?

No. It varies based on different factors. The fact that dad didn’t take 
his meds probably accelerated his decline. The decline is not reversible.


3) I thought dad's head scan didn't show signs of a stroke.

If you read the results from the scan, it said no sign of a recent 
stroke. The memory doctor looked closely at his scans and said that 
there was signs of his brain shrinking slightly, hardening of some blood 
vessels on the outer edge, not taking his meds for diabetes & high blood 
pressure could have contributed to that.

Could the doctor say for sure he had a stroke?  How recently?

 From what she saw, she though had a minor stroke at some point. She 
can’t say when from the scan. Just looks like minors injury to the brain 
from a small stroke at some point.

What's the likelihood of another stroke? She didn’t talk about the 
potential for another strokes. She talked to dad about staying on his 
meds, eating properly and getting exercise.
