This note maybe to complex for Dad to understand but I will ask him to 
talk with us and not call his broker. Dad did write a thank you to Jeff. 
I hadn't seen an email from him in a long while.

Too many things to many things to care of.

Dad,

  You generally should focus on capital preservation with some income 
generation now and have a modest equity exposure.  I would suggest no 
more than 20-30% - and in some index funds. So maybe 10% growth/general 
market fund like VOO or IVV [both indexed to S&P 500], 15-20% in a 
value fund (like VTV or DIVB), and the rest in an bond and income funds.

    I recommend you read and also use the research tools at TD 
Ameritrade to start looking in teh the following:

You have the broker-advised version of the PIMCO Income Fund. I you 
transfer the funds to TD Ameritrade, you can consider moving it to 
another class with reduced fees.  If you read about the fund 
performance, it is one of the better income funds - just the entire 
market was down last year.  the Forbes article mentions some alternatives.

Type in the ticker symbols  for the Exchanged Traded Funds (ETFs) in the 
ETF comparison otool and then click on the tabs to read some of the 
comparisons:
