TBH, I was put in a very tough spot with Dad's financial intentions not 
matching the paperwork.  Namely:

* Dad was told that Hanh no longer wanted to be a beneficiary (July 8th, 
2023).  He agreed to that.

* Before I had time to redo legal papers for Dad to sign, he had his 
stroke (July 11th).

* Yesterday, I asked Hanh to affirm her 7/8 decision, but she declined 
to do so.  Hanh stuck to the mantra of "I don't care about the money 
issues at all," the indifference of which puts me in a very tough 
situation as the fiduciary.

Therefore, I was forced to go back to Dad and ask him about his 
intentions.  Dad then said he is okay with switching back to Hanh 50% 
and Hien 50% on liquid assets.

And that's where we stand.  Now, Dad's intentions and the paperwork once 
again are in agreement.

Thanks,
