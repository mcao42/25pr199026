Attached is the policy. It's bizarre that the Honda Accord coverage is 
different. Sorry, I don't know why and I don't remember why.

I will create a separate authorized user for Mom, if she or you need to 
log in to the Geico account in the future, rather than share my 
password.  Just let me know if there is a need.
