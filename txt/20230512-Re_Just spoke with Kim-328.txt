    Hi Hanh,

    Kim called me just now.  The highlights:

    * When Kim came by on Thursday, Annalise let her into the house. 
    Dad seemingly sneaked out the side right at that moment!  Annalise
    even noted that ("looks like he doesn't want to talk to you!").

    * True to form, Annalise presented herself as warm and friendly, in
    order to gain an ally.  Kim had a favorable impression of her.  And
    also, Kim doesn't want to be seen as taking sides, else Annalise
    might clam up, not allow her in the house in the future, etc.

    * Hence, Kim never talked to Dad!  Kim didn't want any communication
    to get lost in the translation (Annalise!) so Kim left a fact
    sheet.  This fact sheet is realistic, but spells out some of the
    worst things that can happen -- wherefrom, Dad's idea that he could
    lose the house.

    * I gave Kim a quick rundown of mine and your short convos with
    Dad.  I also let her know we are actively strategizing to seek the
    durable POA.
