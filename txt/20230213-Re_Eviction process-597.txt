Hanh,

Although the five-day period expired, the courts are lenient and will 
still allow a defendant's response if the case has not not been closed.

Even if Ken never responds, the judge could close the case as late as 
the end of March, which then allows us to call the Sheriff.  To avoid 
that uncertainty, it's best to come to an agreement with the tenant.

I was treated extremely rudely over the weekend.  Therefore, I assume I 
am no longer welcome to help Dad with (1) evicting Ken and (2) 
supporting him in demanding his money back from his relatives.  I have 
cancelled my hotel and trip to HB, and have made other plans for the 
weekend.

Sam is welcome to rebuild the relationship at any time.  He is always my 
father.  But now, he knows there are limits and there are certain ways 
to treat others with respect.

Thanks,
Huy

    Huy,

    This is good news that Ken didn't respond within the allowed period
    of time.

    Sorry I'm not up to speed. If Ken didn't respond to the Unlawful
    Detainer, and Dad gets default judgement, why negotiate? What
    advantage does Ken have if the sheriff will come to evict him?

        (the date he was served).  I think his five-day allowance
        expired on 2/6.  The court sent him a Notice That You Have Been

        This eviction company seemed to lose a few days.  *After* they
        request a default, we will have some leverage against Ken.  The
        negotiation with him is a must.  There is no way around that.

            As we are not expecting Ken to pay rent after the Notice to
            quit, time is of the essence to get the house ready for
            sale.  The mortgage payments will dismiss Dad’s savings
            considerably.

            Can you provide a status update and how you’re keeping on
            top of the legal firm to avoid further errors and delays?

            H.

                Hi Dad,

                To summarize, here is the eviction process, which could
                take two months to complete.

                1. 3-day Notice to Quit.  Starts today, Monday, 1/23.

                2. End of 3-day period will be Thursday, 1/26.

                3. On Friday, 1/27, Legal Service Centers (hired by us)
                will file landlord's "Unlawful Detainer" complaint
                against Ken.  From that day, he has five days to respond.

                4. Around 2/6, assuming no response from Ken, Legal
                Service Centers will file a Default on your behalf.

                5. The Court processing of that Default could take 3 - 6
                weeks.

                6. Approximately in March, the Court will be able to
                close the case.  Only by then will the County Sheriff be
                called to physically force out the tenant.

                7. After the tenant has been forced out, only after that
                can you withhold services from him.  The most important
                service is that he will be unable to enter the house, as
                you will change the locks at that time.

                Huy
