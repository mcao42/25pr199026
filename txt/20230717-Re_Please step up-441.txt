You're out.  I will ask Dad if medical decisions can be assigned to Hanh.

    This whole situation was created by you and dad.

    Hanh and I tried hard to keep dad healthy when he was here.  The
    doctors all told him that he was at *high risk for a stroke* because
    of his diet, not taking his meds and other high risk health factors.

    Hanh tried really hard to provide him with a good diet and
    maintained his meds to help his health conditions.

    Through your own selfish reasons, you manipulated him to go back to
    HB.  Since going to HB, his health has gone to crap because of lack
    of care, poor diet and not seeking medical care regularly.

    Yes, I haven't said much.  I'm just watching the train wreck that
    you created under the pretense of your "good intentions".

    When I signed up to help it, it was with the intention of him being
    up north.  I can't and won't drop everything to go down to HB
    because you & him are stupid with the decisions that you've made.

        Hien,

        Please, step up and take the health role seriously.  I asked Dad
        why in the world he ever chose you as his health agent.  He
        responded that it was a good idea because you worked for Kaiser.

        The health-care agent is supposed to know Dad's values and be
        respectful of them.  Please, learn about what Dad values and,
        above all, respect them.  Your passivity since Dad's illness is
        absolutely beyond the pale and unacceptable.
