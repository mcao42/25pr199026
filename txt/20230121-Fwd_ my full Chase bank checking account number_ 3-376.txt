DearHuy con:
The transfer went in smoothly.   All $55,000 transferred from your 
account now reached my account completely.
Thank you for a completed transfer.
Dad

Hi Dad, I was just in Chase Bank and completed the transfer.  Thank you 
once again, for helping us out Hang and me in a time of great need.  
Would you please verify the transfer on your end and let me know.

    Hi Dad,

    I made all the deposit into my Chase (6883) account just now.  The
    bank teller said that none of the checks have a hold on them, so all
    of them will clear overnight.  I will drop by the bank tomorrow to
    transfer the funds to your Chase CHK_8629 account.  Would you please
    provide the full account number to me?

    Thanks,
    - Huy

        Hi Dad,

        I hope you had a good ride back home.  Thank you for making the
        time to visit with us, as well as for the many pleasant gifts! 
        You are welcome here anytime, whenever you can make the time. 
        Hopefully, we can make at least one trip to Orange County before
        summer.

        Here is the running total of the loan balance from the two Chase
        accounts:

        image.pngExcel file also attached.

        If we should add an additional amount for interest, given the
        length of the loan for over a year, please let me know.  It
        would be fair, and we are flexible.

        I will be making the deposits today into the "6883" account to
        make the total over $55K.  One of the checks is large, and
        another check is a personal check, so it's not clear to me if
        the total amount will be available immediately.  When it does
        become available, I make a final transfer into your 8629
        checking account; I will keep you posted.  I don't think I have
        your full account number anywhere, so would you please email
        that to me?

        Thanks,
        - Huy
