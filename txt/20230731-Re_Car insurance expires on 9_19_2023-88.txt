    Hi Hanh,

    I am seeing that Dad's car insurance will be expiring on Sep 19th. 
    That includes three cars (Mom's as well; and Mom didn't want to
    share an insurance policy with Dad anymore).  The annual cost is
    high, something like $3,700, so probably I should drop insurance as
    well sell both cars before 9/19.
