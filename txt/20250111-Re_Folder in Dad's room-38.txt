    Jeff,

    I will be dropping off the REG 252 in the room today.  If that is
    not what you want, please let me know and I'll postal-mail it on Monday.

    Thanks,

               Mom tried to take the title transfer material to AAA
        today to file, but they did not accept it since the date had
        been changed (even though initialed).  The DMV site/handbook
        says errors on the title are not accepted, so they gave her REG
        252
        (https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/handbook/vehicle-industry-registration-procedures-manual-2/odometer-mileage-reporting/vehicle-vessel-transfer-and-reassignment-form-reg-262/
        <https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/handbook/vehicle-industry-registration-procedures-manual-2/odometer-mileage-reporting/vehicle-vessel-transfer-and-reassignment-form-reg-262/>)
        to fill out.  This one is not available online since the
        original is required to be filled out on security paper. We
        filled it out but is requires your signature. She would like to
        mail the form to you today.  She/we can drop it to the post
        office if this makes sense.

             The Statement of Facts (form 256) looks ok.

        Thanks,

        Jeff

            Hanh,

            I left a manila folder on Dad's bed shelf.  It has several
            items in it.

            - Corolla:

            1. In the folder is the car registration and 2025 sticker.

            2. For transfer, in the folder there is the car title and
            REG 256 Statement of Facts. This is being done as a gift,
            with a tax advantage. I recommend you write GIFT in the
            Price of Sale field on the back of the title.

            3. A Bill of Sale is not needed. And there's also another
            transfer related form, but that is a seller-only form, which
            I am doing online today.

            - In the folder is also a business license fee statement Mom
            needs to pay, which is payable by phone. Also, I suggest you
            change the address for future use.

            As for car insurance, as you have added Mom to your
            insurance, I will be taking the Corolla and Accord off the
            Geico policy today.

            Thanks,
            Huy
