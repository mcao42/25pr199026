Hanh,

I'm thinking that Dad should move to the Bay Area in September.  I'd 
like to target Sunday, September 10th.  Ideally, to Fremont, since that 
is right at the midway point between your home and mine.  Dad is all for 
it.  Once I narrow down to  two or three good spots, I'll let you know 
what they are.

I'm thinking of hiring a private nurse to accompany him during the long 
transport.  But I am told that that's hard to do, because nobody would 
want to assume the legal liability.

Originally I was thinking of a minimum of two months of him staying at 
the B&C in HB, but I'm not that impressed by what I have seen so far.

* He says there was physical therapy, but not daily.
* Erly is fine (thought she seems too petite to handle heavy people).  
The guy seems really lazy.  He also has an attitude, and he doesn't 
appear to have a good temerament to handle old difficult people.
* I don't see them fortifying drinks with protein like they said they 
do.  I don't see any evidence of activities for the residents.
* I don't see them following instructions about putting thickener in 
liquids.
* The bell and call button weren't where Dad could reach them.

So, this is just an average B&C.  Hyped sales.  But at least with some 
experience, now we know what to look for in the next B&C.
