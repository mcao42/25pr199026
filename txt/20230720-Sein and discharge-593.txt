I spoke to Sein and profusely apologized for not returning her calls.  I 
gave her a number where I can check my voicemails more easily.  Here 
were the major points:

* Dad's discharge is likely to be next week.

* I told her B&C what we're favoring at the moment.  I also told her 
that I value Denise's recommendations, and that therefore we favor the 
place in Fountain Valley that Denise is having me visit first.

* Doctor's visits:  Some places include it in the base fee, some places 
do not.  Depends on the specific B&C.  Sein is not indicating that 
doctor home visits are in the cards.

* Therapeutic visits will be covered by KP.

* The LT base fee covers nearly everything.  As long-term care 
facilities, it's just as the name describes, and they don't try to 
nickel and dime for diaper changes, etc.
