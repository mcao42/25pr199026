Some thoughts.

* Regarding Hien's involvement (long-term):  I view this as a negative 
because of his lack of empathy toward people without money, elderly, 
troubled, cognitively impaired, etc.  In the shorter term, he is a poor 
choice to provide the info to APS because it's all third-hand info to 
him.  And he does not trust Ken, Dad nor Annalise and cannot judge the 
truth of their accounts.  So when APS comes back with questions, I don't 
think he can answer them.
      The more important point is that, long-term, his lack of empathy 
really comes across.  I think it could only end badly if he and Dad 
interact, once we get into the conservatorship phase.

* Heating in the home:  It's illegal for landlords not to provide 
working heating to their tenants.  So that info is about the landlord 
relationship.

* Regarding whether the report should be detailed (which is needed to 
stress it is an emergency):  I think we cannot submit a weak report.  
The time is over for Dad's games.  This must be a strong report that 
launches some action.  And again, the timing is such that Dad will blame 
Ken for this report.
     And we must mention Dad's bad actions because (1) even though the 
actions could be considered criminal, they aren't, after a mental 
evaluation is ordered, finding he is incapable.  (2) The APS case worker 
might be a lazy one who does no real investigation, and just wants to do 
only the minimum.  We have to submit enough facts to force a mental 
evaluation.

* Regarding whether we need a "good cop" for managing Dad's affairs.  My 
thinking has changed about this, the reason being, that he will always 
resent whoever is closest to him who is trying to genuinely help him.  
That person will try to prevent him from making very bad decisions.  He 
resents that because he is the one trying to make (bad!) decisions and 
hates losing control.
       The proper first step is conservatorship because it leads to 
beneficial next steps:  (1) We then can control where he lives.  (2) 
This is the best way of getting rid of Annalise.  (3) We will then be a 
united team (no good cops or bad cops), and he can't have an "escape" to 
Annalise or to a "good cop."

* Regarding Dad resenting the person reporting:  (1) The identity of the 
reporter is kept confidential.  (2) Even if Dad knows the contents of 
the report, he will suspect his tenants (especially Ken).  (3) Even if 
he suspects me, what's much more important is the way each person deals 
with him (the way they talk to him).  So, I'm not too concerned.  (4) 
Even if he suspects we talked to APS, he will *still* resent us for the 
conservatorship proceedings later on.
      So, Mom might be right about this, but I think we need to take the 
strongest steps toward initiating the conservatorship (via APS 
intervention).  And this means giving them full details about the bad 
stuff happening in the house.

* If Mom is worried about consequences, you don't have to be involved in 
any talks with APS.  We talked about you being available on Monday, 
4/17, but actually this shouldn't be necessary.

* Lastly, please remember, Dad has a "bad conscience" about stuff we 
don't even know about.  There are dozens of bad incidents with tenants, 
relatives and others throughout the years that we can't image.  His 
being forced to sell the house later will put those memories behind 
him.  He might feel a lot of relief about that after he starts a new 
chapter of life.

        Huy,
        This is the way the system   worked when i was working for
        social services over 10  years ago
        -The social worker on duty of the day takes phone calls of the
        day and makes separate referrals for each case
        You do not need to go into details, but you manage to get more
        immediate attention and prompt action    to our case
        When the assigned worker call back for more detail you will
        refer to me or hanh
        -Emergency referral can go immediately to the supervisor. All
        referrals will be submitted to the supervisor who prioritizes
        the level of urgency and  assigns the case to workers of  the unit
        -Assigned worker then contacts with the caller for more details
        of the case.
        -He might request to make a home call with nurses, county
        Physician, policeman…for immediate action or interagency
        referral (mental health , financial assistances, housing
        assistance, fire department,  home shelter assistance…)

        -You will a be ask for  your name and phone number for more
        questions
        - you can mention about  my name as ex wife, hanh’s name for
        More information and send back ground information status

        - you should mention  about dad’s social status to get more
        attention or better treatment ,and for  more experienced or
        better  knowledgeable worker

                _*On Monday:*_

                I'll call Adult Protective Services and tell them my
                concerns about Dad.

                /Immediate concerns:
                /

                * He regularly drives without a valid driver license.
                    - Recently he has been in several car accidents. 
                His car is possibly impounded now, following his last
                accident.

                * Threats and plots against one of the tenants (Ken).
                    - Unsubstantiated allegations of rape against that
                tenant, which were part of an eviction attempt that was
                eventually dropped.

                * Illegal harassment of one of the tenants, for which
                Adult Protective Services was called around 4/6.  The
                harassment included physical assault (grabbing clothes
                and spitting) and removal of the tenant's refrigerator.

                * Health hazards:  House and kitchen are very dirty. 
                Feces all over at least one of the bathrooms.  Bio odor
                throughout the house.

                * Fire hazards:  blocked access ways.  Some smoke alarms
                are not working.

                * Tenants have not been informed of his mental
                diagnosis.  Thus they are exposed to a danger of which
                they are unaware.

                /Other concerns:/

                * He is not taking his meds.  He has a diagnosis of
                dementia and diabetes, but often skips his prescription
                meds.

                * Public indecency.  He walks around with his pants
                dropped below his buttocks.  He has incontinence issues
                but does not wear adult diapers.

                * Many police calls to the house (eight in the last
                three months), some of which are against him for
                complaints of assault.

                * Two pet cats in the home, possibly inhumane treatment
                of them.


                *_Long-term desire, for County to assist with:_*

                * Declare incapacitance.
                    - All tenants should be informed, and sign an
                informed consent form.

                * Give the family some guidance for how to be granted
                full conservatorship.
