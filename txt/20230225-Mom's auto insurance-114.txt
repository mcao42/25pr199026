Mom is currently on Dad's auto insurance (AAA of Southern California, 
policy CAA168702883).  Her last proof of insurance shows an expiration 
of 9/19/2022, but we called AAA and verified that the insurance is still 
current and will not expire until around 9/19/2023.

When the insurance expires, mom intends to be covered under a different 
policy. *Therefore, there will be no need to renew the current AAA 
policy after 9/19/2023.*

We asked AAA to send proof of insurance to hvc_bus@yahoo.com 
<mailto:hvc_bus@yahoo.com>. *That email will need to be forwarded to Mom 
so she can have proof of coverage* which she will keep in her car.

Thanks,
