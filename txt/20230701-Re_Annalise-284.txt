Best thing you can do for starters is to visit him every couple months. 
I think he's lonely and that's one of the reasons he keeps annalise 
around. There's zero effectiveness helping him either financially or 
long distance.

    Thanks for the updates, Huy.  I’m just getting through an intensive
    period of wrapping up my job and will leave at the end of the
    month.  What help do you need?

        The Chipper house is nearly ready for rental to a family (four
        bedrooms, two baths; Dad will keep two bedrooms, two baths and a
        kitchenette).  Ken is out and Jeff is currently being court
        evicted.  The two biggest remaining problems for Dad are:

        1. He keeps driving.  In fact, he caused a minor accident just
        yesterday.

        2. Annalise.  Or more precisely, she is easy to get out of the
        house, but Dad has been undecided about her fate.  Therefore she
        keeps getting permitted back in the house.

        I think I can convince Annalise to move out in the August
        timeframe.  By September 1st, there should be a new rental lease
        starting.  Starting in September, hopefully Dad will have
        assisted-living help and can be weened off his cars.
