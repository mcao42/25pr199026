Dad,

FYI, I sent via PRIORITY MAIL, your renewed car registration, bills, and 
statements that I picked up last week from your house.  This 
should arrive _*by Thursday of this week (Feb 23)*_.

PLEASE NOTE KEY MAILINGS (LABELED WITH ACTION NEEDED WHERE RELEVANT):

  * *A Chase credit card bill that needs attention.*  We noted where
    you've setup autopay (Costo Citibank credit card & frontier) and
    paid for overdue notices:  Foundation Valley Hospital Bill of $120,
    parking citation, etc.
  * New DMV Car Registration Sticker for the Toyota Corolla
  * New DMV Senior ID card
  * New Costco Citibank credit card - needs activation
  * I deposited the $3k check from American Equity Annuity into your
    Chase CHECKING Acct.  The bank confirmation slip is in the envelope.
  * Statements from Chase, Citibank, American Equity, JP Morgan, etc. 
    NOTE tax info included.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Hanh
