I doubt it, but it doesn't take too long to get to get insurance quotes. 
I will remind her around September 1st.

        Hi Hanh,

        I am seeing that Dad's car insurance will be expiring on Sep
        19th.  That includes three cars (Mom's as well; and Mom didn't
        want to share an insurance policy with Dad anymore).  The annual
        cost is high, something like $3,700, so probably I should drop
        insurance as well sell both cars before 9/19.
