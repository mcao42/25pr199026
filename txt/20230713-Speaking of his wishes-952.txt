Dad says that when he went into Kaiser to have doctor's permission to 
renew his handicap placard (expired 6/30/2023), they incidentally 
encouraged him to COVID vaccinate.  His response, according to him, was 
overly passive and he went along with it.  That was very recent, right 
around the time the placard expired.

Looking now in Kaiser records, I don't see a record of that vaccination.

I advised the nurse not to give him another vaccination before 
discharge, both because he already had a recent one, and because he 
expressly does not want anymore of these.  You might want to talk to Dad 
about his wishes, when you have the opportunity, and account for them 
when you assist him with his decisions.  These vaccines have been known 
to cause autoimmunity.
