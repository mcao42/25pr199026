    Dad is still thinking about the $60K loaned to his niece.  I told
    him to write it off, but he does not really want to.  None of his
    family wants to help him out (including Bac 8, the father of
    Jessica; and Vui, for whose property Dad *is* on title -- the Vui
    property is a completely different property).

    Dad is under an impression that Hanh will hire a lawyer to sue
    Jessica.  I let him know that I believe that is not happening.

    In Dad's papers, I found a note to the loan company clearly stating
    (1) the transaction date and bank account (but not the actual
    amount) and (2) the intention of the transaction being a gift.

    This is what I propose to be done.

    1. While Dad is still alive, I will handle this as a legal matter. 
    After Dad's death, this should be something the two of you handle,
    if you are still interested.  I'd say he has a 50/50 chance of
    prevailing, but I am more interested in focusing on other things
    that further his well-being.  I am only doing this because Dad gets
    so wound up about it, and he tends to spin his wheels and get upset
    when nobody helps him.

    2. I am going to do the equivalent of putting you two as
    beneficiaries of the promissory note.  Since there's no promissory
    note, I'll have to write an "equivalent."

    3. I am going to handle the lawsuit until it gets to court.  Then
    I'll have Dad hire a lawyer to handle in-court procedure.

    If you'd like your name completely off this, let me know.  I am
    pretty sure you should be listed as plaintiffs for this to work.  If
    lawyers get involved on the other side, they might create creative
    and counter-sue.
