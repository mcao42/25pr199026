Attached is the incident report for my mother's accident. Unfortunately, 
the report itself will be unavailable for weeks, according to the police 
department.

By the way, my sister is helping my mother more closely, so she would be 
a better contact point: Hanh Yu <hanhcaoyu@gmail.com 
<mailto:hanhcaoyu@gmail.com>> .  You can keep using me as a contact 
point, but the turnaround will be a bit slower that way.

Thanks,
Mark (Huy)
