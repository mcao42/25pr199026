Hien has a sickness of being very nosy.  Please be aware he can look at 
your call log and texts if you are on his account.

If you want him to monitor your location, but not pay for your phone or 
look into your business, you can establish a separate account.

What Hien does in violating the privacy of others is extremely 
inappropriate, as usual.  Unless he'd like to give us his personal 
devices so we can root around.

Dad needs his other laptop and his iPad. He can use them for his video 
visits.

The laptop he has with him is mostly used by him to watch porn.

You need to verify that he has those items before leaving HB.

        Hanh - I remembered what you asked me to help with - the DMV
        response.  Below is the excerpt regarding the DMV in Dr. Datta’s
        message.  It predicated on the assumption that dad has a valid
        drivers license.  I don’t think he does.  If he truly doesn’t,
        I’m not sure that there’s a lot of do in response.

        Regarding Department of Motor Vehicle (DMV) reporting;
        California state law requires me to send a form to the
        Department of Public Health if there is a concern regarding
        safety while driving. They notify the Department of Motor
        Vehicles. I have no choice in this matter.
         From the DMV: 'Driving is an activity that uses a number of
        cognitive skills
        <https://hswprodnbm.appl.kp.org/portal/dmv/?1dmy&urile=wcm:path:/dmv_content_en/dmv/about/senior/health/exercise> in
        a complex manner. These cognitive skills include memory, visual
        processing, attention, and the ability to analyze
        driving-related situations to make appropriate decisions.
        Medical conditions and medications common to seniors have an
        impact on cognitive abilities.
        Your muscle strength, endurance, flexibility, and muscle
        reaction to stimuli are all necessary for operating your vehicle
        and for turning your head to view traffic. Age-related physical
        changes and musculoskeletal diseases (such as arthritis) may
        affect your ability to drive safely and comfortably.'
        Please be advised that I, as your Memory Center provider, do NOT
        have the authority to grant you driving privileges, nor to speed
        up the review process; only the DMV has that authority.
        After a report has been filled with the Department of Public
        Health, they notify the DMV who will send paperwork to you to
        fill out. The DMV may suspend your license until they have
        further information about your condition.
        What to do with the paperwork sent by the DMV to you:
        --You should complete your portion including your medical record
        number, sign in the appropriate places on the first page, and do
        one of the following:
        --emailto DSAROMI@kp.org <mailto:DSAROMI@kp.org> (recommended)
        ---send in the mail to:
