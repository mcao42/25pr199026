    I'm not sure, please ask her, but it seems they don't have strict
    rules there.

                Hi,

                Ms. Jeong, Dad's case worker, called. Based on the
                improved lab test results for Dad's kidney, Doctor
                Pelligrino plans to discharge Dad next Tuesday. Cherise
                Pratti will arrange transportation which family pays
                (~$200). All medical equipment have been ordered from
                Kaiser and set up at B&C, incl hospital bed ($25/mo),
                wheelchair ($25/mo rental), commode for shower and
                toilet ($25). Dad is responsible for 10% copay.

                H.
