I went over the options with Dad this past weekend for how to keep 
assets out of probate.  I suggested the easiest handling of each asset 
type, and here are the results.  I don't think it gets any simpler than 
this.

1. Bank accounts:  Owner Ho Van Cao (not the trust).  Payable-on-death 
beneficiaries Hanh and Hien each 50%.

2. Brokerage accounts:  Same as above.

3. Annuity:  This is the area I understand least about.  I need to look 
into specifics.

Here are account types that Dad thinks he does not have:

* Safe deposit boxes

* Retirement accounts

* Life insurance

I need to look over his files this week.  Then I will see if I 
overlooked anything.
