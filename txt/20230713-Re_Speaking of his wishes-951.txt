I spoke to the doctor and she says they will respect his wish.

    Dad says that when he went into Kaiser to have doctor's permission
    to renew his handicap placard (expired 6/30/2023), they incidentally
    encouraged him to COVID vaccinate.  His response, according to him,
    was overly passive and he went along with it.  That was very recent,
    right around the time the placard expired.

    Looking now in Kaiser records, I don't see a record of that vaccination.

    I advised the nurse not to give him another vaccination before
    discharge, both because he already had a recent one, and because he
    expressly does not want anymore of these.  You might want to talk to
    Dad about his wishes, when you have the opportunity, and account for
    them when you assist him with his decisions.  These vaccines have
    been known to cause autoimmunity.
