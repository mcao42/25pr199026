Thanks for the summary.  It sounds like you have your work cut out for 
you tomorrow. Sleep well.

    _*FRIDAY SUMMARY*_

    Most of the following was discussed over dinner among the three of
    us, including Annalise.

    _Preparing them for the TRO/RO service on Monday:_

    Annalise seems to have no idea at all about my TRO, even though I
    told her in a voicemail and in texts.  I prepped the two of them as
    follows:

    * I gave Annalise a long lecture about how:  Even though it's not
    right to be abused and mistreated, she is a guest in Dad's house. 
    If she does not like how she's treated, they should not be together
    and she must find her own place to live.  It is completely
    unacceptable for her to call the police.

    * At first, Dad completely forgot about her reporting him to the
    police on May 1st.  It took him a minute to remember when asked
    directly.  After his recall came back, he got livid at her and told
    her she needs to move out.  I think Dad was drowsy from his
    high-carb dinner, though, so his anger fairly quickly subsided.

    * Annalise denied ever calling the police on Dad.  I think she
    clearly got very defensive after my lecture.  She claims that she
    would never ever call the police on Dad.  She said she always
    diffuses the situation when Dad starts to get mad, unless it happens
    so suddenly that she does not see it coming.

    _Signing the eviction papers against Ken:_

    * We did so, and Dad seems to understand the whole process.

    * I emphasized 3-4 times to Dad that he must not harass Ken for the
    remainder of the eviction.

    * He asked me whether the RO by Annalise against Ken has anything to
    do with the eviction.  I told him they are two completely separate
    things.  I did not understand what his real concern was, but
    thinking about it more, I think he means:  The RO is faster; he
    doesn't like the idea of Ken staying free another 4-5 weeks; and he
    doesn't like having to leave Ken unmolested.  So, he does not want
    the eviction to in any way negatively affect the RO.

    * Dad insisted that I talk to Mary, who is Annalise's "lawyer" from
    Texas.

    * On the eviction papers, Dad declared he receives about
    $2,500/month in social security.  When Annalise saw that, she said,
    "No wonder your Dad calls me the rich widow!  I'll tell you what. 
    Let's take a vacation together.  I will pay for all expenses!"  I
    looked at him to see if he was feeling slighted.  Probably so, but
    not too overtly.

    _POA and Kim/public guardian:_

    Annalise says Dad was very upset about this for several days, and
    she had to work a lot to calm him down.  She told him that "the
    guardian" seems to be some sort of helpful service, where a bunch of
    volunteers come to you and a bunch of them do everything for FREE.

    So I had to work up Dad to being scared of the public guardian
    again.  I reminded him that Michelle opened the public-guardian case
    against him, and that the public guardian would use Dad's assets to
    help Dad.

    Dad's fear of the public guardian has to be worked up again before
    we can effectively talk about POA.  Therefore I didn't get much into
    talking about POA today.

    I asked Dad if he's talked to you yet about POA.  He said no, he has
    not! ðŸ¤¯

    _Selling the house:_

    Jason Ortiz had told me his people have been talking to Dad about
    selling the house.  But Dad says he hasn't been talking to anyone
    about that!

    Seems Dad is in no hurry to kick out Jeff.  Only Ken.

    _*SATURDAY STRATEGY*_

    * Talk to Mary (lawyer).  Then report back to Dad that the RO
    against Ken and the eviction have nothing to do with each other.
        - But the TRO/RO against Annalise obviously does affect the RO
    against Ken.  I will have to think about this.  Mainly, this is the
    reason i don't really want to talk to Mary.

    * Reinforce to both of them that the public guardian isn't there to
    do free stuff for free.  Then bring up POA.
