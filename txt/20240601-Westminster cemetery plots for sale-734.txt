Mom,

The info I have is that TheCemeteryExchange.com should have the most 
reasonable listing rate.

    TheCemeteryExchange.com appears to have a relatively low commission
    cost for selling a cemetery plot, with listing fees ranging from
    $71.95 to $329.95. This is a one-time fee, and there are no hidden
    fees or commissions. This makes it a more cost-effective option
    compared to other platforms that may charge higher fees or commissions.

Also, we can list on Facebook Marketplace at the same time.  If you are 
okay with this, I will start listing the Westminster Memorial plots.
