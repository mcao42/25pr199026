_*On Monday:*_

I'll call Adult Protective Services and tell them my concerns about Dad.

/Immediate concerns:
/

* He regularly drives without a valid driver license.
    - Recently he has been in several car accidents.  His car is 
possibly impounded now, following his last accident.

* Threats and plots against one of the tenants (Ken).
    - Unsubstantiated allegations of rape against that tenant, which 
were part of an eviction attempt that was eventually dropped.

* Illegal harassment of one of the tenants, for which Adult Protective 
Services was called around 4/6.  The harassment included physical 
assault (grabbing clothes and spitting) and removal of the tenant's 
refrigerator.

* Health hazards:  House and kitchen are very dirty.  Feces all over at 
least one of the bathrooms.  Bio odor throughout the house.

* Fire hazards:  blocked access ways.  Some smoke alarms are not working.

* Tenants have not been informed of his mental diagnosis.  Thus they are 
exposed to a danger of which they are unaware.

/Other concerns:/

* He is not taking his meds.  He has a diagnosis of dementia and 
diabetes, but often skips his prescription meds.

* Public indecency.  He walks around with his pants dropped below his 
buttocks.  He has incontinence issues but does not wear adult diapers.

* Many police calls to the house (eight in the last three months), some 
of which are against him for complaints of assault.

* Two pet cats in the home, possibly inhumane treatment of them.


*_Long-term desire, for County to assist with:_*

* Declare incapacitance.
    - All tenants should be informed, and sign an informed consent form.

* Give the family some guidance for how to be granted full conservatorship.
