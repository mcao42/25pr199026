Hi Huy,
I have need waiting and waiting and just seen your email
It is great that you have a favorable opinion about the condition of the bc
To my opinion, dad really needs me to see him as often as possible
With my frequent visit,his mentality and his physical health have 
  noticeable improved
On my part, at the age of 81, i chose to devote the rest of my life for 
dad no matter how much i have to struggle
I have tried  very hard to stay strong, but i come to the point that i 
am exhausted and fear of  danger in driving and sleelessness
Please weight those factors with the dis advantage in your consideration
The past few months i have been under a lot of stress from driving long 
distance and spending time away from home, in order to have time to take 
care of dad
I beg you to understand us and let dad move to Castro Valley Blessing  
Home Assisted living
We do not have much time to live!
Dad and I have worked vey hard and went through a lot in our lives and 
we deserve a better. In our very difficult time!
Simcerly,
Your mother

    Hi Mom,

    I went to Castro Valley today after work to check out the assisted
    living facility. The positives about it include that Elena appears
    to be nice on a first impression, and her home was clean at the time
    I visited.

    Weighing advantages and disadvantages of moving Dad, I do not see
    any advantages for him of this new home; and I see some
    disadvantages. Because of that, it is best for him to stay at his
    current residence.

    Thanks,
    Huy
