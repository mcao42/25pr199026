Dear Mother and Hanh,

I want to address some ongoing issues concerning Dad's care and 
well-being. It's crucial that we all respect his autonomy and ensure his 
peace for the time he has remaining.

_Normative Expectations:_

People, including the elderly, should live their lives without 
unsolicited interference. When someone appoints a Power of Attorney, it 
should be respected, with legal avenues available for disputes rather 
than harassment. Part of the role of the POA is to protect the elder.  I 
do not want to exercise POA powers to restrict others, but I will do so 
if Dad's happy and health continue to be be so adversely affected.

_Concerns:_

* The term "wife" should not be used by someone who is legally an 
ex-wife, as it causes confusion and disrupts Dad's peace.

* Financial transactions, like the payment to Elena at the B&C in Castro 
Valley, should be examined to ensure they are made legally and with 
Dad's best interest in mind.

* Suggestions for Dad's care to the B&C or to hospice personnel, 
especially regarding custody or health decisions, should come from those 
legally appointed or through proper channels.

* Claims of POA by a daughter whose authority has been long revoked can 
lead to confusion and legal issues.

* Discussions about euthanasia are highly sensitive and should be 
approached with utmost care and legality, especially coming from a daughter.

* Interference with professional caregivers can compromise Dad's health 
and well-being.
Bringing spoiled or expired food to Dad poses high health risks and 
should never happen again.

_Impact of Recent Actions:
_
The stress placed on Dad, particularly around New Year's Eve, has had 
visible emotional and health implications. His expressed wish to die 
following these interactions is deeply concerning.

*Please reflect on how your actions might be affecting Dad. It’s 
important we all work towards his comfort and autonomy, not against it. 
While I've hesitated to limit your visits, continued stress might very 
necessitate more formal boundaries to protect his health.
*
I urge you to consider the impact of your involvement and strive to 
support Dad in ways that align with his expressed wishes and medical advice.

Best regards,
Huy
