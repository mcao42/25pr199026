Ron,

Here are the facts of assault, as alleged by Annalise Hunt.

Annalise is an 80 year old woman who is also a tenant at 16272 Chipper 
Lane in Huntington Beach.  On 12/25/2022, she was vaginally raped by Ken 
VanNatta.  Her injuries were not only vaginal, but also included bruises 
to her shoulder and ribs from an assault.  On that same day, 12/25, she 
went to Fountain Valley Regional Hospital Emergency Room.  She believes 
the hospital then filed a police report.

On Wednesday, 1/18/2023, Annalise's hand bag was stolen by someone 
inside the house.  She believes the thief was Ken VanNatta, since he was 
the only person in the home who could have taken the bag.  She later 
found the bag dumped in the garage, but missing her phone and wallet.

She has reported Mr. VanNatta often being menacing, threatening and 
crude toward her.  Please note that Mr. VanNatta is openly a porn 
addict, evident from his social media Web pages:
