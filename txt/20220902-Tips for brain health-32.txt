Mom & Hanh,

I came across a couple of very good health tips recently.

For mom:

* To increase insulin sensitivity, after exercising, wait as long as 
possible before eating carbs (mainly, sugar and fructose).  For example, 
after a walk, do not have a smoothie right away.  If you let your body 
stay in the "after exercise" (low blood-sugar state) until morning, then 
it can use all that time to increase insulin sensitivity.  (Source:  Dr. 
Ben Bikman.)

For Hanh:

* For doing long intermittent fasting and getting into autophagy, let 
your last meal of the day be in the morning or early afternoon for 
maximum brain benefit.  The reason is that 14-16 hours into a fast, CMA 
(Chaperone Mediated Autophagy) is activated.  For strong brain benefit, 
the brain should be in a low activity state while CMA is taking place.

Mobeen talks about Chaperone Mediated Autophagy.
