Thanks Hien.  They need to get everything set up at the Board & Care for 
Dad's discharge on Thursday.

What do they need, authorization? Proper set up is important. Dad is 
essential incapacitated. He has to be transported in a gurney. He cannot 
sit up in wheelchair.

I'm traveling tomorrow afternoon. Maybe better if they try Huy first.  
Can you provide name and phone number to call back?

H.

    I got a voicemail from Apria Health Care about some equipment that
    was ordered. I donâ€™t know anything about it. It thought that they
    will either call you or Huy about medical stuff.
