Okay, I will add you anyway, in case your schedule changes.

        Good afternoon Michelle,

        We were wondering if another meeting with you tomorrow
        (Wednesday), anytime 1-2 or 3-4:30, for a duration of 15 to 30
        minutes, is possible?

        As we processed the information exchanged last week, some
        questions came up.  We know for sure we will contact a lawyer
        very soon (most likely this week).  Perhaps we should let the
        attorney orchestrate legal matters (RO and eviction) rather than
        to do so ourselves right away.

        In particular with respect to RO's potentially to be filed on
        behalf of our father against his friend (Annalise) and his
        tenant (Ken), I am not sure if those actions will advance the
        conservatorship.  So, your additional input about issues of
        guardianship could help us with some planning.

        Best regards,
        Mark
