Thanks so much.  I'm not sure if Dad can read but I gave him a printout 
of the announcement.

        Hi,

        Here’s info on a new post that I’ve taken on. It’s not full time
        but a fun next step for me to learn.  I’ll also be doing some
        independent consulting.  A former SPR colleague and I just found
        out we won a nice contract with the Ford Foundation.

        Hanh
