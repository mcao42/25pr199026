Hanh,

I left a manila folder on Dad's bed shelf.  It has several items in it.

- Corolla:

1. In the folder is the car registration and 2025 sticker.

2. For transfer, in the folder there is the car title and REG 256 
Statement of Facts. This is being done as a gift, with a tax advantage. 
I recommend you write GIFT in the Price of Sale field on the back of the 
title.

3. A Bill of Sale is not needed. And there's also another transfer 
related form, but that is a seller-only form, which I am doing online today.

- In the folder is also a business license fee statement Mom needs to 
pay, which is payable by phone. Also, I suggest you change the address 
for future use.

As for car insurance, as you have added Mom to your insurance, I will be 
taking the Corolla and Accord off the Geico policy today.

Thanks,
Huy
