Last night, I found a proper gift letter from Jessica's mortgage company 
signed by Dad.  He signed it a couple of months after the money 
transfer.  At the time of the transfer, he had signed a gift letter that 
wasn't legally binding.

So, if Jessica kept a copy of that gift letter, I think he can kiss the 
$60K good bye.

I have been very busy fixing Chipper.  Will be able to provide an 
accurate snapshot of his financial situation in about two weeks, when 
I'm more freed up.
