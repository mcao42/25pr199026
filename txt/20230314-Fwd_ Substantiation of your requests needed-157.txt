FYI, Ken is playing the California disability game with Dad.  It could 
take several months to get him out, but at least, he is paying rent 
during the time.

Dear Ken,

Can we switch to messaging by email?  Your texts are very long and as 
such are hard to read and to reply to.

I will need you to provide documentation supporting your medical 
requests.  This is given your (forgive me) reputation for not following 
through on your words in the past.

* I just had your 3-day Notice (eviction) dismissed, due to your request 
to make time for your medical procedure.  In effect, I changed that to a 
60-day Notice.  You said you needed two months for medical recovery, 
which is how long 60 days is.  But now you say that 60 days is not long 
enough.

* Others have said that you habitually talk about surgeries, only to see 
that no surgery ever actually takes place.

Because of your poor track record of keeping your word, I require you to 
back up your demands.

* My father is trying to sell his house, but you demand $5,000 and are 
blocking that.  Is that amount really necessary for you?  Because it 
feels extortionary to me.  It is beyond the pale.  But if you back up 
your claim for this need, we can try to work with it.

* What is your basis for claiming that you need two months of recovery?

* Provide for me documentation about the dates of upcoming medical 
procedures.

Thanks,
Mark
