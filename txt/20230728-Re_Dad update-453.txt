Thank you to Hang for being there for the transfer. Tuesday is my last 
day of work. I need to turn in my badge, computer, etc.

Do you think i can come to the place today to see his room and bring 
flowers and books to create a welcoming etc computer him?

Should I call Michele? What's her last name?

H.

        Hi,

        Ms. Jeong, Dad's case worker, called. Based on the improved lab
        test results for Dad's kidney, Doctor Pelligrino plans to
        discharge Dad next Tuesday. Cherise Pratti will arrange
        transportation which family pays (~$200). All medical equipment
        have been ordered from Kaiser and set up at B&C, incl hospital
        bed ($25/mo), wheelchair ($25/mo rental), commode for shower and
        toilet ($25). Dad is responsible for 10% copay.

        H.
