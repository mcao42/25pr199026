Yes, I saw that tab. That list is consistent with the papers I've seen 
and also with his asset list when he applied for his most recent 
mortgage.  That's how I got that his assets are around $500K, if the 
accident settlement is included.

    Btw. Did you see the tab in the password spreadsheet with Dad's
    accounting of his assets? I took a picture of his scrawl and also
    typed up to what he told me. I'm sure it's only a starting point.

    H.

        Last night, I found a proper gift letter from Jessica's mortgage
        company signed by Dad.  He signed it a couple of months after
        the money transfer.  At the time of the transfer, he had signed
        a gift letter that wasn't legally binding.

        So, if Jessica kept a copy of that gift letter, I think he can
        kiss the $60K good bye.

        I have been very busy fixing Chipper.  Will be able to provide
        an accurate snapshot of his financial situation in about two
        weeks, when I'm more freed up.
