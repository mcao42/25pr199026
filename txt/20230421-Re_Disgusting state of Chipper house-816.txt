Ugh!!

I don't know why the tenants stick around. They must be desperate for 
housing.

    stand being in there.  Dad invited me to eat, and I said no thanks.

    There appear to be small insects (fruit flies?) hovering over the
    trash.  The floors look like they have not been mopped in a decade. 
    On the tables and counters, things pile up, so there is not a normal
    empty area for eating.  Hallways and walkways are lined with boxes
    and furniture, making walking around hard to do.

    You have to be there to believe it.  If you view pictures, it
    actually does not look bad.

    The absolutely worst thing is the strong bio odor.  It gets worse
    and stronger with each visit.  The smell is unique to his house, so
    honestly I don't know what it is exactly, but Michelle seemed to
    think there's a feces component to it.

    I had to drive Dad's car earlier today, so I sat where he usually
    sits.  The smell (feces?) stuck to me for about an hour.
