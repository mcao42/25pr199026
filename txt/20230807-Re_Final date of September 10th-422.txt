Hi Mark-
Thank you for the advance notice. Your dad is progressing well. We are 
starting him on a chopped diet today.
We will try and increase his time in the wheelchair daily to prepare for 
the move.
We will keep in touch regarding his improvements and move out.
Take care
Michelle

    Dear Michelle,

    This note is to let you know of my intention to have my father's
    move-out date from Sterling (15442 Columbia Lane in Huntington
    Beach) be Sunday, September 10th, 2023.

    He is gaining strength faster than we expected.  This move-out plan
    is consistent with our intention to have him be closer to us in
    Northern California, where we can more effectively participate in
    his care.

    Best regards,
    Mark
