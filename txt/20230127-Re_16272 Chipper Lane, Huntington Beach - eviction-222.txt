* Ken has read the notice.  He called the eviction company and said he 
was "appalled" by the accusation.

* Later, the company asked me if we (Annalise) are prepared to back up 
the accusation in court.  I said that she's willing to sign an 
affidavit, and that the hospital visit (Christmas day, 2022) was real 
and can be substantiated.

* I told the eviction company to go ahead with the Complaint, and see if 
Ken responds during the five-day period.

                    Ron,____

                    ____

                    Here are the facts of assault, as alleged by
                    Annalise Hunt.____

                    ____

                    Annalise is an 80 year old woman who is also a
                    tenant at 16272 Chipper Lane in Huntington Beach. 
                    On 12/25/2022, she was vaginally raped by Ken
                    VanNatta.  Her injuries were not only vaginal, but
                    also included bruises to her shoulder and ribs from
                    an assault.  On that same day, 12/25, she went to
                    Fountain Valley Regional Hospital Emergency Room. 
                    She believes the hospital then filed a police
                    report.____

                    ____

                    On Wednesday, 1/18/2023, Annalise's hand bag was
                    stolen by someone inside the house.  She believes
                    the thief was Ken VanNatta, since he was the only
                    person in the home who could have taken the bag. 
                    She later found the bag dumped in the garage, but
                    missing her phone and wallet.____

                    ____

                    She has reported Mr. VanNatta often being menacing,
                    threatening and crude toward her.  Please note that
                    Mr. VanNatta is openly a porn addict, evident from
                    his social media Web pages:
