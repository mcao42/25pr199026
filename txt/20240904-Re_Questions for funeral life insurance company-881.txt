Mom,

I just talked to Westminster Memorial Park.

All burial contracts are either already under your name, or under your 
name and Dad's jointly, with you having right of survivorship. So, there 
is no hurry to sell them. After Dad passes away, you still have all 
rights to those properties to sell.

    Hi Mom,

    Here's the info.

    Company:  American Memorial Life Insurance, *(800) 533-2220.*
    Contract #:  6-489783 (Ho V Cao)
    Contract #:  6-489784 (Thanh X Huynh)
    Benefit _per_ contract:  $9,347.  Cash value:  $7,410.
    For prearrangement with:  Peek Family Funeral Home, 7801 Bolsa Ave,
    Westminster, CA 92683.

    I would call the life insurance company at the 800 number above.
    Just let them know you no longer live in Westminster, and that you
    are planning to sell all your cemetery and funeral contracts.  Then
    ask them whether the two prearranged funeral contracts can be
    transferred to a buyer.
