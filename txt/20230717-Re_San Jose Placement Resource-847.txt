I realized your father already discharged.

If you inquire at Pavillion of Sunny Hills, please ask for a new 
Advanced Directive to be completed.

You can also request to speak with the case manager and doctor there, yes.

Hello Mark,

Thank you for reaching out. I will have the assigned social worker speak 
with you more on this.

I am at another hospital today, yet this is good that your father has 
already voiced his new wishes.

Our Social Worker will be happy to assist with providing a new Advanced 
Directive for your father to complete.

Kind regards,

Hi Monique,

I am very concerned about my brother, Hien Cao, being assigned as the 
health decision maker for my father.  My father no longer wants this, 
due to my brother's complete silence and poor attitude since my father's 
illness six days ago. My father expressed yesterday that I should be the 
decision maker, but I will see if he's amenable to my sister taking that 
role.

Should I get in contact with my father's doctor/case manager to see 
whether it is okay for him to sign another advance health-care directive 
at this time?  I believe he still has a presence of mind, but that his 
health will be declining even more in the future, so this may be the 
last viable opportunity to make this very important change.

Mark
