Okay, I can remind her about a month ahead of time. But it takes only a 
few days to get insurance. She just need somebody's help

    Mom's not quick to react to things and might need help.  You might

                Hi Hanh,

                I am seeing that Dad's car insurance will be expiring on
                Sep 19th.  That includes three cars (Mom's as well; and
                Mom didn't want to share an insurance policy with Dad
                anymore).  The annual cost is high, something like
                $3,700, so probably I should drop insurance as well sell
                both cars before 9/19.

                Huy
