Hi Mark, your Dad seems to be exhibiting signs of Alzheimer's. Some days 
he seems okay, but other days he's really out of it! That's my 
observation. Also he brought back that woman, Annalise, who your Dad 
told police several weeks ago that she has Dementia. And both last night 
and tonight she left a burner on, on the kitchen stove after she had 
gone to bed. I discovered that when I went into the kitchen around 10PM 
tonight and about the same time last night. She never cleans anything 
and leaves all the pots and pans and dishes dirty. Your Dad used to keep 
everything clean and also clean the kitchen table after he ate, but he 
no longer does that. Elise everything a mess, which he did not used to 
do! Question: Do you have Power of Attorney over your Dad? He appears as 
if he is becoming incompetent and Analise's dementia and forgetfulness 
is becoming a danger to the safety of everyone
  here as well as to this property! The shrubs and weeds on the side of 
the house are all overgrown. I would trim it myself but your dad has no 
tools to do that. So again do you have power of attorney? Thanks! Ken
