Huy,

This is good news that Ken didn't respond within the allowed period of 
time.

Sorry I'm not up to speed. If Ken didn't respond to the Unlawful 
Detainer, and Dad gets default judgement, why negotiate? What advantage 
does Ken have if the sheriff will come to evict him?

H.

    * I called the company handling the eviction on Friday and left them
    a message that they should be filing a Default (to have the Court
    process closure of the case), since Ken did not respond during the
    allowed time (5 days).  That clock started on 1/30 (the date he was
    served).  I think his five-day allowance expired on 2/6.  The court
    sent him a Notice That You Have Been Sued on 2/3.

    * I did not hear back from the company.  So I will keep calling them
    each business day until I get a reply.

    This eviction company seemed to lose a few days.  *After* they
    request a default, we will have some leverage against Ken.  The
    negotiation with him is a must.  There is no way around that.

        As we are not expecting Ken to pay rent after the Notice to
        quit, time is of the essence to get the house ready for sale. 
        The mortgage payments will dismiss Dad’s savings considerably.

        Can you provide a status update and how you’re keeping on top of
        the legal firm to avoid further errors and delays?

            Hi Dad,

            To summarize, here is the eviction process, which could take
            two months to complete.

            1. 3-day Notice to Quit.  Starts today, Monday, 1/23.

            2. End of 3-day period will be Thursday, 1/26.

            3. On Friday, 1/27, Legal Service Centers (hired by us) will
            file landlord's "Unlawful Detainer" complaint against Ken. 
             From that day, he has five days to respond.

            4. Around 2/6, assuming no response from Ken, Legal Service
            Centers will file a Default on your behalf.

            5. The Court processing of that Default could take 3 - 6 weeks.

            6. Approximately in March, the Court will be able to close
            the case.  Only by then will the County Sheriff be called to
            physically force out the tenant.

            7. After the tenant has been forced out, only after that can
            you withhold services from him.  The most important service
            is that he will be unable to enter the house, as you will
            change the locks at that time.

            Huy
