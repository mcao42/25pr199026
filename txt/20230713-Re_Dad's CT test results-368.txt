Yes, unless it's inpatient rehab, it would be very difficult. 
Transferring dad right now would be difficult also.

    I should also mention what the case manager (Brian) told me
    yesterday.  He looked into whether rehab can be done elsewhere, but
    the answer is pretty much no. That is an unusual circumstance they
    aren't able to plan for.  the more nuanced answer was:

    * Normally he would rehab in OC, then improve before being
    transferred elsewhere (possibly relocation).

    * He mentioned about a "remote" rehab transfer started several
    months ago that went nowhere.  The destination location was
    unresponsive.

    * I told him that an outpatient rehab in OC would be completely
    unworkable, as there's nobody here to support Dad.

    Given all that, Brian said he'd research some more and talk to me
    again today.

        Thanks for the update. So you need for me to go to OC? If yes, 
        I'm thinking of renting a car and driving down.

            Hanh,

            There were at least three CT scans done on him.  The first
            showed nothing.  The second (or it could be the MRI) showed
            a blood clot.  Then they did the third one because they
            suspected progression, but fortunately, the third scan did
            not show further clotting or other advances.

            The head nurse told me the stroke was complete, which I
            believe means the stroke has stabilized, and the test
            results are valid.  Here's where he currently stands:

            * verbal use of language, very poor.  He definitely has
            problems saying words, but the problem is more than motor
            skills.
            * right side of the body is much weaker than the left.  Poor
            control.
            * he has to both poop and pee in bed.
            * he seems to have discomfort more than any kind of pain.*
            * he seems a bit depressed.
            * cognitive abilities are poorer than when I saw him last
            weekend.  Hopefully that is just temporary.

            Today, the PT and occupational therapist will both evaluate,
            and recommend a plan for transfer to rehab.  Given his
            condition and situation, you would think they would
            recommend an inpatient setting for the next stage, but I
            understand these decisions are financially driven.

            If they do recommend an outpatient arrangement for rehab, I
            don't know how that could possibly work from OC.

                Huy... Any update on Dad?

                His test results had very technical language but one of
                the things I saw from the CT scan was:  "There is
                extensive hypoattenuation in the periventricular white
                matter."

                This suggests: Periventricular white matter
                hyperintensities increase the likelihood of progression
                from amnestic mild cognitive impairment to dementia.

                Dad already has dementia but I wonder the effects of the
                stroke on his cognitive abilities.

                H.
