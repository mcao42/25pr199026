    Hi Mom,

    Here are photos of the Crosby repair. Some photos are "before"
    repair, and some after:

    I used one of your personal checks to deposit a final payment for
    Tai for $1,000 to cover his interior repairs.

        Hi Mom,

        I am going to use one of your blank checks for me for the
        following amounts:

        Geico - $700
        Crosby mold, Stage 1 (diagnosis) - $1,400
        Crosby mold, Stage 2 (roof fix) - $1,600
        *TOTAL - $3,700* (see attachment)

        For Geico, that's about your fair share. In April 2024, I paid
        $2,382 for the next six-month policy period.  You do a lot less
        mileage than us, so your share of the total should be less.

        As for the Crosby fixes, here is a further breakdown.

        Stage 1, deposit - $1,400 paid by Huy
        *Stage 1, final payment - $1,400 paid by Maria*

        *Stage 2, deposit - $1,900 paid by Maria*
        Stage 2, final payment - $1,600 paid by Huy

        To reimburse Maria, you simply credit her for $3,300 = $1,400 +
        $1,900. That means that she effectively already paid for her
        August 1st rent.

        For the final stage, of restoring the interior, Tai will do that
        next week.
