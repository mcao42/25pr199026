Same for me. My only wish for dad is to have money to cover his expenses 
and life a comfortable life after a lifetime of hard work and any 
decisions regarding his assets and finances are consistent with that.

        Dad is still thinking about the $60K loaned to his niece.  I
        told him to write it off, but he does not really want to.  None
        of his family wants to help him out (including Bac 8, the father
        of Jessica; and Vui, for whose property Dad *is* on title -- the
        Vui property is a completely different property).

        Dad is under an impression that Hanh will hire a lawyer to sue
        Jessica.  I let him know that I believe that is not happening.

        In Dad's papers, I found a note to the loan company clearly
        stating (1) the transaction date and bank account (but not the
        actual amount) and (2) the intention of the transaction being a
        gift.

        This is what I propose to be done.

        1. While Dad is still alive, I will handle this as a legal
        matter.  After Dad's death, this should be something the two of
        you handle, if you are still interested.  I'd say he has a 50/50
        chance of prevailing, but I am more interested in focusing on
        other things that further his well-being.  I am only doing this
        because Dad gets so wound up about it, and he tends to spin his
        wheels and get upset when nobody helps him.

        2. I am going to do the equivalent of putting you two as
        beneficiaries of the promissory note.  Since there's no
        promissory note, I'll have to write an "equivalent."

        3. I am going to handle the lawsuit until it gets to court. 
        Then I'll have Dad hire a lawyer to handle in-court procedure.

        If you'd like your name completely off this, let me know.  I am
        pretty sure you should be listed as plaintiffs for this to
        work.  If lawyers get involved on the other side, they might
        create creative and counter-sue.
