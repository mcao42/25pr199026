    Huy,

    Thank you for the cc.  FYI the email was addressed to Hang, rather
    than Hanh.  I forwarded it this morning.

        To Ms. Huynh and Ms. Yu:

        Geico called me this morning, stating that they received the San
        Jose PD police report about the car collision of 12/16/2024.

        Attached are two letters. One is from December, but I am
        attaching it for your records in case you never downloaded it.

        The second letter is dated 2/14/2025. It is time-sensitive.  It
        is important you review it.  I am CCing Jeff Yu, who has been
        less selective with email replies, to make sure that Ms. Huynh
        receives this important letter.

        Cordially,
        Mark Cao
