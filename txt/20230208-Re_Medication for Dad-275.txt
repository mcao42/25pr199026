    I'm not saying it's true, but In Dad's mind, he's still eligible to
    drive b/c he has the senior ID issued by DMV.

        Hanh - you had a question about memory medication.  Below is a
        message that dad got from the Kaiser pharmacist this morning (it
        says take vitamin D because his level is low.  You’re already
        doing that.  Just check to see how many he needs to take for
        1,000 unit).
