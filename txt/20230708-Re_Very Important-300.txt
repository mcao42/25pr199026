I don't want to hurt Dad's feelings but I'm sure he'll need all his 
resources to get the care he needs.

    Thank you. Yes, I already took you off as primary trustee. You are
    now the first contingent trustee. Per your wishes, I will let dad
    know and take you off as any kind of beneficiary.

    If you are unwilling to serve any kind of role in the healthcare
    directive, that also would be good to know.

    It's not good to involve the neighbors in this. As I hinted before,
    at least one of the neighbors is a bigot. Dad asked one of his
    neighbors to be a witness for these signings, so revisions is not
    something I want to do regularly.

        I'd like to be taken off the list as Dad's beneficiary and
        primary trustee. I had assumed that you've taken on that role,
        Huy because of the power of attorney.

        I don't want to speak for Hien. He can let you know himself, his
        preference.

        All I meant to say was I prefer for you to be the beneficiary
        since you've been doing all of the work to take care of Dad.

            After months of preparation of Dad's docs and finances, in
            which I kept you in the loop, Hanh texted to me several days
            ago.  It must have taken Hanh several seconds to do this. 
            She texted her preference to have Hanh and Hien be removed
            as any kind of beneficiary for Dad's assets (I can provide a
            screenshot if that is needed).

            As I stated before, any kind of decision like this is fine
            with me.  It's equitable.  Mom will be subtracting from or
            outright removing anybody favored by Dad to assure equity. 
            And this is fine with me to have Mom opposing what I am
            doing for my parent.  I absolutely cannot do the right thing
            for my aging parent if Mom imposes her conditions on how I
            help my parent.

            Please, know that it takes significant resources, the most
            valuable of which is time, to do these things.  But it seems
            worthwhile to do Dad's documents once to get it right.  If
            you are unwilling to be:

            * his trustee (someone he can rely on)
            * his beneficiary

            then please let me know now so I can help redo his
            documents, just one more time.

            There is a lot of urgency to these tasks because of (1) his
            age and (2) things like his $250K settlement for which his
            lawyer does not seem to be in any hurry to close.  Therefore
            beneficiary assignments are needed.

            Thanks,

            Huy
