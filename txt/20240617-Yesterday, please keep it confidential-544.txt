love you grandma

Love you too!

I feel so good about your job

me too!!! I'm saving more money now than I ever was before, it's nice.

I am thinking of helping you to buy a condo. I have talked to your 
father about it
I heard that the CA gov gives the first time home buyer $50,000 toward 
the price of the house
If you thnk about it, let me know

really?

i was just talking to my girlfriend about what we should do about 
homeownership.

my plan has always been for me to own something and her to pay me a 
rent, so I was discussing that with her again to see if she was still 
comfortable with it.

You are wise
You know how to do business
Renting out a room to help you financially at the beginning is a good 
strategy.
Partnership is very hard to handle if there is conflict later
