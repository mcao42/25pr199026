Hi Mom,

Here is what I told you over the phone yesterday:

The cemetery listing has *not* been posted yet. Nobody has seen it yet, 
except for the people who run the website.

Any part of it can be edited at any time, including the price.

I think what you have is only worth $22,000 in the third-party 
Marketplace. So that's what I proposed to be posted. But I said I could 
be wrong about that. And, again, nobody has seen the $22,000 listing 
yet. Because it has not been posted to the public.

If I can help you in any way with this listing, just let me know, and I 
will provide you with the information you need. For now, I'm freezing 
the posting so the public won't see it.

Thanks,
Huy
