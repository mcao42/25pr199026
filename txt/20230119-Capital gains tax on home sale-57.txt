Hi Chu Y!

I hope this email finds you well!  You are our go-to for accounting 
questions, and I have a big one.  Dad lived in part of the house while 
renting out the rest.  At one point, Dad added a granny unit ("duplex").

Dad is considering selling his house (market value $1.2 million).  Cost 
basis is $82K.  Here are the methods of which we are aware to reduce or 
defer the capital gains tax:

1. $250K exemption for single filer.  Dad has been single filing.
2. Add home improvements to the cost basis (say, $300K).
3. Try to use a 1031 exchange rule:
      - Dad lived in one part of the house.  Consider this part to be 
his primary residence.
      - The rest of the house, considered as an investment property, is 
eligible for deferring of capital gains tax.

Using #3, I can see how he can avoid paying all capital gains tax, but 
it doesn't sound easy to do.  Any advice on how he can proceed?
