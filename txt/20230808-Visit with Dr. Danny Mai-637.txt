* Doc mentioned about how Dad didn't do any visits for about 3 years, 
and that his non-compliance contributed to his blood sugar getting out 
of control.

* Regarding the stroke, I told the doc about Dad's recent improvements.
    - Speech much easier to understand.  Eating is much more normal, 
with no coughing and being able to eat Vietnamese chao.
    - right leg also seeing significant improvement, with flexing now 
doable.
    - he has always been able to listen and understand and doesn't seem 
to have aphasia.
    - right arm still completely limp.
    - He has gotten a bit more feisty (cantankerous) since he became 
stronger.

* The doc and I discussed Dad moving to another B&C in Northern 
California.  Doc is totally fine with this and thinks it's better for 
Dad to be near family.

* He thinks SoCal and NoCal KP are not "stoved piped" and are fairly 
seamless in transferring services.  So if the patient has therapy 
benefits, they should transfer to the new location.

* I mentioned we're considering professional non-emergency medical 
transport, but he believes that is not necessary for Dad's case.

* He says one of the main concerns about Dad remains kidney function.  
Metformin can adversely affect kidney function, and for that reason, was 
discontinued.
