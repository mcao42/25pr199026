Geez, they wore me out. I was on hold for ~45 minutes just for them to 
let me know that the delivery might be delayed! While I had them I asked 
about assisting the order, they tranferred me to /another/ dept to 
cancel the hospital bed and commode.

He only needs the wheelchair rental. So, Huy, you'll need to set up with 
Apria Billing online to pay his 10% copay for the $25/mo.wheelchair rental.

        April Health Care called me again.  I talked with the person
        from there.  They said that they’re not trying to sell
        anything.  They’re calling about medical equipment that dad
        needs one he leaves.  They’re calling on behalf of Kaiser.  I
        gave that person both of your names & numbers.
