I am trying to reference information sources closer to the California 
vehicle code.  Here's what I concluded from readings:

1. I filled out the title transfer correctly (as POA signer), except for 
the wrong year (2024).

2. The correction for the date error above is supposed to be REG 101.  
That is what I'll be leaving in the room today.

3. The REG 262 is not the right form for corrections. Even if it were, 
corrections to REG 262 itself cannot be handled on the form itself. A 
new REG 262 has to be filled out.

Again, this is information closer to the CA vehicle code. After you 
receive the forms (I'm leaving some duplicates), let me know what else I 
can do.

Thanks,
Huy

    I'll be going to the postoffice and mailing two "Statement of Error
    or Erasure," so you can use one for the title, and one for the REG
    262. Having that could increase your chances of getting this
    accepted by a DMV official.

    And if you still need me to request a replacement title, let me know.

        Jeff,

        When I filled out the REG 262 over the weekened, I wrote my
        driver's license number instead of Dad's.  Well, I am pretty
        sure that's not correct, so I went to the DMV in Los Gatos today
        to get advice and/or a new REG 262 form. Unfortunately, it got
        more complicated from there.  Just as I suspected, apparently
        these employees have differing interpretations of how to fill
        out these various forms.

        She said to me:
        (1) The date correction should have been done simply using REG
        101 Statement to Record Ownership, on the back of which is a
        "Statement of Error or Erasure." She gave me a form, but it's
        just on plain paper; so, fortunately it's likely to be
        downloadable if another blank is needed.
        (2) I shouldn't have signed as POA the way I did. Dad, despite
        his dementia, could at least initial the title. And he must do
        that, she said.  She implied that a replacement title does not
        have to be obtained, and that the extra owner's signature (Ho
        Van Cao) can be done on the existing form.

        I think she might be right about #1, but I doubt she is right
        about #2 (although she insisted she is right).  Let me know if
        you have good ideas about how to proceed. Personally, I think
        best is one of the following:

        (A) Use the REG 101 to note the mistake of the date on the
        title; or,
        (B) Use a REG 227 (Application for Duplicate title) and start
        from scratch.

        I think there is a good shot that (A) will be accepted. But if
        we want to be sure, we do (B).

                   Mom tried to take the title transfer material to AAA
            today to file, but they did not accept it since the date had
            been changed (even though initialed).  The DMV site/handbook
            says errors on the title are not accepted, so they gave her
            REG 252
            (https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/handbook/vehicle-industry-registration-procedures-manual-2/odometer-mileage-reporting/vehicle-vessel-transfer-and-reassignment-form-reg-262/

            to fill out.  This one is not available online since the
            original is required to be filled out on security paper. We
            filled it out but is requires your signature. She would like
            to mail the form to you today.  She/we can drop it to the
            post office if this makes sense.

                 The Statement of Facts (form 256) looks ok.

            Thanks,

                Hanh,

                I left a manila folder on Dad's bed shelf.  It has
                several items in it.

                - Corolla:

                1. In the folder is the car registration and 2025 sticker.

                2. For transfer, in the folder there is the car title
                and REG 256 Statement of Facts. This is being done as a
                gift, with a tax advantage. I recommend you write GIFT
                in the Price of Sale field on the back of the title.

                3. A Bill of Sale is not needed. And there's also
                another transfer related form, but that is a seller-only
                form, which I am doing online today.

                - In the folder is also a business license fee statement
                Mom needs to pay, which is payable by phone. Also, I
                suggest you change the address for future use.

                As for car insurance, as you have added Mom to your
                insurance, I will be taking the Corolla and Accord off
                the Geico policy today.

                Thanks,
                Huy
