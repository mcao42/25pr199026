Thank you, Chu Y, very valuable input!  Hien has a good tax advisor 
we'll be consulting with before making any big decisions.

Glad to hear that your family is well!  Our daughter, Zoe, recently 
turned seven.  She is a handful, very energetic!!  Our son, Leo, is in 
high school and is very into fitness.

I am now working at a medium-sized war-industry company (Sierra Nevada 
Corp), after working in the war industry for Boeing in the early 
2000's.  Between the current job and Boeing, I worked for the evil :-( 
drugging industry for about 10 years, but at the time, I didn't know 
Pfizer etc. were so nasty.  Ah well, live and learn.

Will call you up in the coming days to catch up.  Are you still at the 
same phone number?

    Hi Huy,
    How are you and your family are doing?
    We are doing fine here.

    Regarding your tax question, it is beyond my expertise.  You / your
    dad should consult a tax expert on this matter.

    I am tempting to say not to sell because the tax codes allow the
    house to be valued at its fair market at the time of the owner
    passes away, not owner’s tax basis (stepped-up basis).  So the heirs
    can sell it at that time without incurring a large tax bill. 
    However, since I don’t know his plans, his financial situations, his
    health condition, etc., I cannot give you/him any advice on what to do.

    If your dad decides to talk to planners and/or tax experts, one of
    you should be there to gain the understanding and for your own benefits.

    Call me when you have a chance.
    Chú Ỵ
