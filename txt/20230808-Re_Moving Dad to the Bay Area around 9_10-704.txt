It's this something that Kaiser can help us set up too? Can we get a 
quote from them?

    Okay.  We're going to have to think about this and get second
    opinions.  Meanwhile, I requested a quote from

        Even if Dad is doing better, you should arrange for an ambulance
        to transport him to Bay Area.

            I am starting the process of moving Dad out of Sterling. 
            This has to be started early because I'm sure they have an
            advance notice that has to be adhered to.  I am assuming
            that is 30 days.

            If his move needs to be delayed, we'll cross that bridge
            later ...

                Okay.

                I'll keep an eye on the staff when I'm there next week
                and help out where I can.  Caretaking of the
                bedridden elderly is difficult work. Dad has a lot of
                needs. I noticed that if he's physically weak, he's
                sweet and mellow. As he gets stronger, he can get
                psychologically unstable, demanding, and foul tempered.

                If Dad is more stable by early Sept, it's good to get
                him up here.  LMK if you need help with visiting sites
                in Fremont.  There's a cluster of Kaiser facilities on
                Paseo Padre, including a Kaiser Hospital.

                Kaiser hospital
                39400 Paseo Padre Pkwy · (510) 248-3000
                Open 24 hours

                FYI.  I have a number of trips coming up:

                  * 8/14-18 - OC
                  * 8/22-29 - N. Carolina
                  * 9/6-9/8 - MN
                  * 9/12-15 - Portland
                  * 9/18-23 - OC
                  * 9/26-929 - LA

                I bought plane tickets to visit Dad 9/18- 9/23, but
                can cancel the flight if Dad's in the Bay Area.

                    Hanh,

                    I'm thinking that Dad should move to the Bay Area in
                    September.  I'd like to target Sunday, September
                    10th.  Ideally, to Fremont, since that is right at
                    the midway point between your home and mine.  Dad is
                    all for it.  Once I narrow down to  two or three
                    good spots, I'll let you know what they are.

                    I'm thinking of hiring a private nurse to accompany
                    him during the long transport.  But I am told that
                    that's hard to do, because nobody would want to
                    assume the legal liability.

                    Originally I was thinking of a minimum of two months
                    of him staying at the B&C in HB, but I'm not that
                    impressed by what I have seen so far.

                    * He says there was physical therapy, but not daily.
                    * Erly is fine (thought she seems too petite to
                    handle heavy people).  The guy seems really lazy. 
                    He also has an attitude, and he doesn't appear to
                    have a good temerament to handle old difficult people.
                    * I don't see them fortifying drinks with protein
                    like they said they do.  I don't see any evidence of
                    activities for the residents.
                    * I don't see them following instructions about
                    putting thickener in liquids.
                    * The bell and call button weren't where Dad could
                    reach them.

                    So, this is just an average B&C.  Hyped sales.  But
                    at least with some experience, now we know what to
                    look for in the next B&C.

                    Huy
