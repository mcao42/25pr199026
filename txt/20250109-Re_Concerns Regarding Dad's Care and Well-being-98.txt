Be very careful, Huy. You're relaying lies from people who have 
consistently gained financially from Dad being in his current hospice 
and BC arrangement.

When hospice patients live more than 6 months and are doing as well as 
Dad has under mom's care, Dad should be reassesed to see if hospice is 
the correct course.

I asked Maylin this several times if she can have Dad reassessed and 
have not heard an answer from you or her. Unacceptable.

I've said this multiple times to you, Maylin, the BC staff, and Dad: I 
want Dad to LIVE and have a high quality of life. I am asking Kaiser, as 
his daughter, to reassess if hospice is appropriate. He seems to be 
going stronger than ever with the attention Mom had given him. He 
deserves much better care than he's getting currently which is substandard.

Best regards,

Hanh

    Dear Mother and Hanh,

    I want to address some ongoing issues concerning Dad's care and
    well-being. It's crucial that we all respect his autonomy and ensure
    his peace for the time he has remaining.

    _Normative Expectations:_

    People, including the elderly, should live their lives without
    unsolicited interference. When someone appoints a Power of Attorney,
    it should be respected, with legal avenues available for disputes
    rather than harassment. Part of the role of the POA is to protect
    the elder.  I do not want to exercise POA powers to restrict others,
    but I will do so if Dad's happy and health continue to be be so
    adversely affected.

    _Concerns:_

    * The term "wife" should not be used by someone who is legally an
    ex-wife, as it causes confusion and disrupts Dad's peace.

    * Financial transactions, like the payment to Elena at the B&C in
    Castro Valley, should be examined to ensure they are made legally
    and with Dad's best interest in mind.

    * Suggestions for Dad's care to the B&C or to hospice personnel,
    especially regarding custody or health decisions, should come from
    those legally appointed or through proper channels.

    * Claims of POA by a daughter whose authority has been long revoked
    can lead to confusion and legal issues.

    * Discussions about euthanasia are highly sensitive and should be
    approached with utmost care and legality, especially coming from a
    daughter.

    * Interference with professional caregivers can compromise Dad's
    health and well-being.
    Bringing spoiled or expired food to Dad poses high health risks and
    should never happen again.

    _Impact of Recent Actions:
    _
    The stress placed on Dad, particularly around New Year's Eve, has
    had visible emotional and health implications. His expressed wish to
    die following these interactions is deeply concerning.

    *Please reflect on how your actions might be affecting Dad. It’s
    important we all work towards his comfort and autonomy, not against
    it. While I've hesitated to limit your visits, continued stress
    might very necessitate more formal boundaries to protect his health.
    *
    I urge you to consider the impact of your involvement and strive to
    support Dad in ways that align with his expressed wishes and medical
    advice.

    Best regards,
    Huy
