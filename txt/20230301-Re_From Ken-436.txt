    Hi Mark, your Dad seems to be exhibiting signs of Alzheimer's. Some
    days he seems okay, but other days he's really out of it! That's my
    observation. Also he brought back that woman, Annalise, who your Dad
    told police several weeks ago that she has Dementia. And both last
    night and tonight she left a burner on, on the kitchen stove after
    she had gone to bed. I discovered that when I went into the kitchen
    around 10PM tonight and about the same time last night. She never
    cleans anything and leaves all the pots and pans and dishes dirty.
    Your Dad used to keep everything clean and also clean the kitchen
    table after he ate, but he no longer does that. Elise everything a
    mess, which he did not used to do! Question: Do you have Power of
    Attorney over your Dad? He appears as if he is becoming incompetent
    and Analise's dementia and forgetfulness is becoming a danger to the
    safety of everyone
      here as well as to this property! The shrubs and weeds on the side
    of the house are all overgrown. I would trim it myself but your dad
    has no tools to do that. So again do you have power of attorney?
    Thanks! Ken Van Natta
