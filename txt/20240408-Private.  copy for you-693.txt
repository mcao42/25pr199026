Please take care of your mother by your own way!

Hanh,
I already ordered the cat scat pike  rolls. I learned about that pike 
mat  from the very nice Daiso clerk
Thank you for taking me with you yesterday and other times
I am confident that i am better that some dummy think about me
I am always observe and understand you (and others) VERY much, and 
  accommodate others
The reason i keep myself from others, because I am, of course 
vulnerable, but I know how  and when to express myself   without hurting 
others
I LOVE and Care about  you and dad more than myself. You are my life!
No matter what others think about me, i do not care, i only care about you!
Please reserve yourself!
I learned from CoDA and meditation and yoga that i am not to should and 
ought on myself and stop being a people's pleaser
At the beginning stage of my of those learning, i behaved correctly 
until I blowed up in the past
Please reserve yourself and stand up for yourself, understand your right 
to be a person and do not let others hurt you directly or indirectly
You grown up as a GOOD person
I still have my painful memories    , but i know when or what to talk 
outloud about it
I could not  believe that i started LATE my healthy life until this age, 
owning to all my CoDA sessions in San Ramon: " Love and preserve yourself "
With strong will, i survived difficulties and laughed quietly and 
proudly  at those fake  and phony people!
Please don't  feel obligated to spend time with me!
I am confident that i am alone but NOT lonely!
