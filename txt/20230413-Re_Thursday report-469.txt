I think that Dad hit a still object or  hit and run
That was Vien told me was in Hawai , about the big den at one side of 
the car that he could not open the door
His tenant did not see his car because the car was sent to body shop to 
fix justv enough to open the door

    Thanks for the intel.  Hard to believe that this is Dad's "new" car.

        Most interesting findings from today.

        * I went by the Chipper house.  Dad's black Corolla is not in
        great shape, but it is at the house (see attached, below).  To
        be honest, I can't tell if these dents are new or old.  I didn't
        notice them last time, but I was not looking for dents.  As you
        can tell, the dents are more or less noticeable, depending upon
        the viewing angle.

        * I texted to my cop friend.  She offered to have her friends
        pull over Dad, but unfortunately she thought he's in San Jose. 
        Basically, the police didn't take Ken too seriously.

        * I got the last 5 weeks of police/emergency reports (summary)
        from Ken.

              1. 3/7 "Hope Contact."  I don't know what this means. 
        Maybe has to do with Annalise's mental health ... That's my best
        guess.

              2. 3/18 Dad fell.

              3. 4/1 "415 disturbing the peace".  Ken reported that Dad
        grabbed him.  The police did not consider this an assault, just
        a dispute.

              4. 4/2 "919 keep the peace".  Ken reported Annalise was
        bullying him.  The police thought the elderly people were just
        arguing among themselves.

              5. 4/6 "919 keep the peace".  Ken reported Dad was banging
        on his door, demanding rent money.

              6. 4/7 "1021 phone call".  Ken reported Dad stole his food
        (frig).  Police think this is just people bickering.

              7. 4/7 "1021 phone call".  One hour later, Ken called the
        police again about the missing frig.  The police told him not to
        call again.
