Limited scope is just a document for the attorney. The attorney does 
have an appearance fee  of $175.00

Hi Miranda,

Can you confirm that the limited-scope attorney representation for our 
case is at no additional cost, above what was originally paid?

Thanks,

Mark

    Miranda,

    I have been trying to search OC cases by:

    case number:  30-2023-01305196-CL-UD-CJC

    plaintiff:  Ho Cao

    defendant:  Ken Vanatta (the last named is purposely misspelt)

    address:  16272 Chipper Lane, Huntington Beach, CA 92649

    But no luck.  In early February, I was able to find the case.  Any
    idea why I can't find it?  I am trying to see if the defendant ever
    responded to the case.

    Mark

            Court Staff have commented:

            Hello, the filing has been received but has not been
            processed. Staffing challenges have created significant
            backlogs for these filings. At this time, I’m unable to give
            you a time estimate as to when it will be processed. We will
            try to get to it soon, thank you for your patience!
