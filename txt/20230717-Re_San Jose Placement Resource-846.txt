    Hi Monique,____

    __ __

    I am very concerned about my brother, Hien Cao, being assigned as
    the health decision maker for my father.  My father no longer wants
    this, due to my brother's complete silence and poor attitude since
    my father's illness six days ago. My father expressed yesterday that
    I should be the decision maker, but I will see if he's amenable to
    my sister taking that role.____

    __ __

    Should I get in contact with my father's doctor/case manager to see
    whether it is okay for him to sign another advance health-care
    directive at this time?  I believe he still has a presence of mind,
    but that his health will be declining even more in the future, so
    this may be the last viable opportunity to make this very important
    change.____
