Mom,

I want to let you know that Dad had a big doctor appointment yesterday 
to do a memory assessment.  The diagnosis and recommendations are not 
surprising given our observation of him:  Mild to Moderate Dementia, 
Don't Live Alone, and Should not Make Financial or Health Decisions on 
His Own.  (See Letter for more details).

As expected, he is very emotional and upset, especially about the 
doctor's reporting to DMV.

The most informative part is the instructions to caregivers for those 
with dementia and Alzheimer's.  This will get more difficult, so we will 
take on the advice as Dad's condition changes.  He seems to be getting 
more alert as we get a better handle on his meds and really enforce a 
much healthier diet and lifestyle.  He is responding well to the 
treatment and has been in good spirits and very cooperative.  Positive 
reinforcement!

Hanh
