            Hi Ron,

            When you have an idea of around when the notice will be
            served, would you please let me know?

            Also, just as an informal rule of thumb, is two weeks about
            the expected time frame till when the sheriff will force out
            the tenant? Assuming:

            * the tenant doesn't comply with the 3-day notice

            * the tenant does not oppose the court complaint

            Thanks,

            Mark

                Ron,

                Here are the facts of assault, as alleged by Annalise Hunt.

                Annalise is an 80 year old woman who is also a tenant at
                16272 Chipper Lane in Huntington Beach.  On 12/25/2022,
                she was vaginally raped by Ken VanNatta.  Her injuries
                were not only vaginal, but also included bruises to her
                shoulder and ribs from an assault.  On that same day,
                12/25, she went to Fountain Valley Regional Hospital
                Emergency Room.  She believes the hospital then filed a
                police report.

                On Wednesday, 1/18/2023, Annalise's hand bag was stolen
                by someone inside the house.  She believes the thief was
                Ken VanNatta, since he was the only person in the home
                who could have taken the bag.  She later found the bag
                dumped in the garage, but missing her phone and wallet.

                She has reported Mr. VanNatta often being menacing,
                threatening and crude toward her.  Please note that Mr.
                VanNatta is openly a porn addict, evident from his
                social media Web pages:

                Mark
