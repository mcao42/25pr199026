I am adding Hanh and Hien as beneficiaries, per Dad's approval of my 
recommendation, as part of the strategy of avoiding probate for all 
assets.  For the beneficiary assignment:

* I am listing your address as part of your identification.  They also 
allow SSN entry, but that's optional.  I do not know your SSN's.  To me, 
this is a bit dangerous, because if you move in the future, we'll have 
to remember to update all the beneficiary addresses.  Please provide 
your SSN if you want that entered.

* I am assuming your name as it appears on your DL is:
Hanh Cao Yu
Hien Thanh Cao

If that's not the case, please let me know.
