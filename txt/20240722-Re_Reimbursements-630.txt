Hi Mom,

Here are photos of the Crosby repair. Some photos are "before" repair, 
and some after:

I used one of your personal checks to deposit a final payment for Tai 
for $1,000 to cover his interior repairs.

    Hi Mom,

    I am going to use one of your blank checks for me for the following
    amounts:

    Geico - $700
    Crosby mold, Stage 1 (diagnosis) - $1,400
    Crosby mold, Stage 2 (roof fix) - $1,600
    *TOTAL - $3,700* (see attachment)

    For Geico, that's about your fair share. In April 2024, I paid
    $2,382 for the next six-month policy period.  You do a lot less
    mileage than us, so your share of the total should be less.

    As for the Crosby fixes, here is a further breakdown.

    Stage 1, deposit - $1,400 paid by Huy
    *Stage 1, final payment - $1,400 paid by Maria*

    *Stage 2, deposit - $1,900 paid by Maria*
    Stage 2, final payment - $1,600 paid by Huy

    To reimburse Maria, you simply credit her for $3,300 = $1,400 +
    $1,900. That means that she effectively already paid for her August
    1st rent.

    For the final stage, of restoring the interior, Tai will do that
    next week.
