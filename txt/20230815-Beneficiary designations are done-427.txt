All the beneficiary designations that were possible to do, are now 
completed.

But I couldn't do the following due to their differing policy, so I'll 
simply transfer out all the money to BofA:

* Chase checking and savings (should take less than two weeks if I try 
to do $5K per day)
* Citi checking and savings (relatively inactive, small amount of cash)

I didn't bother with the "death of beneficiary before the owner" case, 
since the chances of that are slim, and you didn't tell me your 
preference.  So in all cases, the untimely death of one of you will 
result in the other (*not* your children) getting the asset.

FYI, previously, the accounts mostly had no beneficiary designations.  A 
couple of accounts listed Mom while a couple of accounts named Hanh as 
the beneficiary.

Probably before early September I'll export all his asset statements.  
Hopefully his statements will show evidence of beneficiary designations.

Other news:

* Regarding brokerage accounts:  I told Dad I thought his putting $100K 
in cash and fixed income in his brokerage accounts is too conservative, 
considering that he'll eat into his other $100K of liquid cash very 
slowly (considering he should eventually get $6K/month of rental 
revenue).  But he disagreed and said to just leave the brokerage 
accounts as he set them up.

* iPhone to be returned to Hien soon, or at least fair compensation for it.

    The beneficiary designations are now almost completed. The POA has
    been submitted for all accounts, or the beneficiary designations
    were directly done.

    For the accounts where a POA was submitted, it should take another
    week to either transfer the funds out (to BofA, where beneficiaries
    are designated) or to designate beneficiaries using the POA
    authority.  Once everything is completed, I'll record the info.

    On a different topic:  I notice that his brokerage accounts are very
    conservative.

    Schwab $120K - most of it is in a mutual fund.  Okay.
    BofA $30K.  Cash!
    Chase $73K.  Fixed income.

    There is $30K + $73K that is too conservatively invested,
    considering that he has $100K+ of cash elsewhere.  I will ask him if
    he wants the BofA and Chase in an index fund instead.

        I'm putting a priority on:

        * making sure all of Dad's liquid assets are beneficiary-designated
        * transferring all checking/savings cash to BofA
        * transferring brokerage assets to BofA, *if* the broker does
        not allow me to designate beneficiaries using the POA
            - the same goes for money-market accounts

        The following don't need to be transferred right away to BofA:

        * brokerage accounts and money-market accounts that do allow a
        POA to designate the beneficiaries

        The POA assignment definitely allows all financial transactions
        (hence my ability to transfer any assets to BofA).  The gray
        area is whether beneficiaries can be changed by the POA
        appointee, with different banks having different rules.
