    I am starting the process of moving Dad out of Sterling.  This has
    to be started early because I'm sure they have an advance notice
    that has to be adhered to.  I am assuming that is 30 days.

    If his move needs to be delayed, we'll cross that bridge later ...

        Okay.

        I'll keep an eye on the staff when I'm there next week and help
        out where I can.  Caretaking of the bedridden elderly is
        difficult work. Dad has a lot of needs. I noticed that if he's
        physically weak, he's sweet and mellow. As he gets stronger, he
        can get psychologically unstable, demanding, and foul tempered.

        If Dad is more stable by early Sept, it's good to get him up
        here.  LMK if you need help with visiting sites in Fremont. 
        There's a cluster of Kaiser facilities on Paseo Padre, including
        a Kaiser Hospital.

        Kaiser hospital
        39400 Paseo Padre Pkwy · (510) 248-3000
        Open 24 hours

        FYI.  I have a number of trips coming up:

          * 8/14-18 - OC
          * 8/22-29 - N. Carolina
          * 9/6-9/8 - MN
          * 9/12-15 - Portland
          * 9/18-23 - OC
          * 9/26-929 - LA

        I bought plane tickets to visit Dad 9/18- 9/23, but can cancel
        the flight if Dad's in the Bay Area.
        H.

            Hanh,

            I'm thinking that Dad should move to the Bay Area in
            September.  I'd like to target Sunday, September 10th. 
            Ideally, to Fremont, since that is right at the midway point
            between your home and mine.  Dad is all for it.  Once I
            narrow down to  two or three good spots, I'll let you know
            what they are.

            I'm thinking of hiring a private nurse to accompany him
            during the long transport.  But I am told that that's hard
            to do, because nobody would want to assume the legal liability.

            Originally I was thinking of a minimum of two months of him
            staying at the B&C in HB, but I'm not that impressed by what
            I have seen so far.

            * He says there was physical therapy, but not daily.
            * Erly is fine (thought she seems too petite to handle heavy
            people).  The guy seems really lazy.  He also has an
            attitude, and he doesn't appear to have a good temerament to
            handle old difficult people.
            * I don't see them fortifying drinks with protein like they
            said they do.  I don't see any evidence of activities for
            the residents.
            * I don't see them following instructions about putting
            thickener in liquids.
            * The bell and call button weren't where Dad could reach them.

            So, this is just an average B&C.  Hyped sales.  But at least
            with some experience, now we know what to look for in the
            next B&C.
