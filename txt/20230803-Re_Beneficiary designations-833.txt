The beneficiary designations are now almost completed. The POA has been 
submitted for all accounts, or the beneficiary designations were 
directly done.

For the accounts where a POA was submitted, it should take another week 
to either transfer the funds out (to BofA, where beneficiaries are 
designated) or to designate beneficiaries using the POA authority.  Once 
everything is completed, I'll record the info.

On a different topic:  I notice that his brokerage accounts are very 
conservative.

Schwab $120K - most of it is in a mutual fund.  Okay.
BofA $30K.  Cash!
Chase $73K.  Fixed income.

There is $30K + $73K that is too conservatively invested, considering 
that he has $100K+ of cash elsewhere.  I will ask him if he wants the 
BofA and Chase in an index fund instead.

    I'm putting a priority on:

    * making sure all of Dad's liquid assets are beneficiary-designated
    * transferring all checking/savings cash to BofA
    * transferring brokerage assets to BofA, *if* the broker does not
    allow me to designate beneficiaries using the POA
        - the same goes for money-market accounts

    The following don't need to be transferred right away to BofA:

    * brokerage accounts and money-market accounts that do allow a POA
    to designate the beneficiaries

    The POA assignment definitely allows all financial transactions
    (hence my ability to transfer any assets to BofA).  The gray area is
    whether beneficiaries can be changed by the POA appointee, with
    different banks having different rules.
