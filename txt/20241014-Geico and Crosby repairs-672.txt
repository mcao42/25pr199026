Hi Mom,

The total for recent reimbursements to me should be $1,761 = $700 + 
$1,061  which includes:

_Geico car insurance:_

$700 for the upcoming period 10/10/2024 to 4/10/2025.  This is based on 
a $2,467 policy premium, but cost is mostly based on mileage, and you 
drive less than Hang and I do. This compares to the original premium of 
about $2,000. I think car insurance is going up fast for everyone.

Crosby repairs of the downstairs master bathroom totaled $1,061. That 
was for:

* Toilet replacement
* Faucet replacement
* Vanity and sink replacement
* Labor

The cost breakdown:

* Materials:  $661 = $391 + $270 (receipts attached)
* Labor:  $400

Maria gave feedback that she thinks Tai did a good job. The 
replacements of toilet and faucet were expected, but the vanity, 
including sink, were unexpected. The sink was in very bad shape (see 
photos of cracks on the top and bottom), so Tai recommended they be 
replaced now.

Thanks,
Huy
