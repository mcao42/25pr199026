Yes, that's at least the presumption.  John told me only about a $200 
ambulance fee for the transfer.  If the SNF were to cost $10K, he would 
have told me.  I think we will have all the details once a discharge is 
ready.

    Thanks for the update.  Will Kaiser cover the cost of rehab and his
    being at this place?

        They will be transferring him by ambulance to a Skilled Nursing
        Facility, probably in Santa Ana.  It could be as early as
        today.  He will stay there 1-3 weeks.  They noted that the plan
        for the longer term is to transfer him to Assisted Living in San
        Jose.
