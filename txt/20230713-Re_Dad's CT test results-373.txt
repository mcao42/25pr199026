Hanh,

There were at least three CT scans done on him.  The first showed 
nothing.  The second (or it could be the MRI) showed a blood clot.  Then 
they did the third one because they suspected progression, but 
fortunately, the third scan did not show further clotting or other advances.

The head nurse told me the stroke was complete, which I believe means 
the stroke has stabilized, and the test results are valid.  Here's where 
he currently stands:

* verbal use of language, very poor.  He definitely has problems saying 
words, but the problem is more than motor skills.
* right side of the body is much weaker than the left.  Poor control.
* he has to both poop and pee in bed.
* he seems to have discomfort more than any kind of pain.*
* he seems a bit depressed.
* cognitive abilities are poorer than when I saw him last weekend.  
Hopefully that is just temporary.

Today, the PT and occupational therapist will both evaluate, and 
recommend a plan for transfer to rehab.  Given his condition and 
situation, you would think they would recommend an inpatient setting for 
the next stage, but I understand these decisions are financially driven.

If they do recommend an outpatient arrangement for rehab, I don't know 
how that could possibly work from OC.

    Huy... Any update on Dad?

    His test results had very technical language but one of the things I
    saw from the CT scan was:  "There is extensive hypoattenuation in
    the periventricular white matter."

    This suggests: Periventricular white matter hyperintensities
    increase the likelihood of progression from amnestic mild cognitive
    impairment to dementia.

    Dad already has dementia but I wonder the effects of the stroke on
    his cognitive abilities.
