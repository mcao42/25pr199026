Hi Miranda,

Can you confirm that the limited-scope attorney representation for our 
case is at no additional cost, above what was originally paid?

Thanks,
Mark

    But no luck.  In early February, I was able to find the case.  Any
    idea why I can't find it?  I am trying to see if the defendant ever
    responded to the case.____

            Hello, the filing has been received but has not been
            processed. Staffing challenges have created significant
            backlogs for these filings. At this time, I’m unable to give
            you a time estimate as to when it will be processed. We will
            try to get to it soon, thank you for your patience!
