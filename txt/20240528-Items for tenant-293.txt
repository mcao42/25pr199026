Hi Mom,

I suggest you do the following.

1. Let the tenant know the handyman's schedule.  He thinks he can fix 
the moisture damage around mid-June.

2. You will issue a 60-day notice to her, for tenancy ending 8/31/2024.  
So the notice should be issued 6/30/2024 or earlier.

3. You should let her know what the new rental amount will be.  
Otherwise, she will assume the worst and look for a new place.
