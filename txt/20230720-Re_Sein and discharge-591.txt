    Thanks for the update.

    Can we request for them to discharge Dad next Thursday or Friday?

    I need to take care of critical work meetings next Wednesday in LA
    and can focus fully on Dad after that.

    Also, just booked a flight to LB 8/10-8/17.

        I spoke to Sein and profusely apologized for not returning her
        calls.  I gave her a number where I can check my voicemails more
        easily.  Here were the major points:

        * Dad's discharge is likely to be next week.

        * I told her B&C what we're favoring at the moment.  I also told
        her that I value Denise's recommendations, and that therefore we
        favor the place in Fountain Valley that Denise is having me
        visit first.

        * Doctor's visits:  Some places include it in the base fee, some
        places do not.  Depends on the specific B&C.  Sein is not
        indicating that doctor home visits are in the cards.

        * Therapeutic visits will be covered by KP.

        * The LT base fee covers nearly everything.  As long-term care
        facilities, it's just as the name describes, and they don't try
        to nickel and dime for diaper changes, etc.
