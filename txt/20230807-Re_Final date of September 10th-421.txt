Much appreciated, Michelle!

I don't not much about stroke recovery, but my mind was blown when he 
did this yesterday:

This was a first for him, to be able to flex his "paralyzed" right leg.

    Hi Mark-
    Thank you for the advance notice. Your dad is progressing well. We
    are starting him on a chopped diet today.
    We will try and increase his time in the wheelchair daily to prepare
    for the move.
    We will keep in touch regarding his improvements and move out.
    Take care
    Michelle

        Dear Michelle,

        This note is to let you know of my intention to have my father's
        move-out date from Sterling (15442 Columbia Lane in Huntington
        Beach) be Sunday, September 10th, 2023.

        He is gaining strength faster than we expected.  This move-out
        plan is consistent with our intention to have him be closer to
        us in Northern California, where we can more effectively
        participate in his care.

        Best regards,
        Mark
