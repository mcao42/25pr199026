Are you there with Dad full time, Huy?

I can visit Dad and help with whatever is needed 7/27-7/28 and 9/30-10/1.

Will that work for Dad and you?

H.

    Best thing you can do for starters is to visit him every couple
    months. I think he's lonely and that's one of the reasons he keeps
    annalise around. There's zero effectiveness helping him either
    financially or long distance.

        Thanks for the updates, Huy.  Iâ€™m just getting through an
        intensive period of wrapping up my job and will leave at the end
        of the month.  What help do you need?

            The Chipper house is nearly ready for rental to a family
            (four bedrooms, two baths; Dad will keep two bedrooms, two
            baths and a kitchenette).  Ken is out and Jeff is currently
            being court evicted.  The two biggest remaining problems for
            Dad are:

            1. He keeps driving.  In fact, he caused a minor accident
            just yesterday.

            2. Annalise.  Or more precisely, she is easy to get out of
            the house, but Dad has been undecided about her fate. 
            Therefore she keeps getting permitted back in the house.

            I think I can convince Annalise to move out in the August
            timeframe.  By September 1st, there should be a new rental
            lease starting.  Starting in September, hopefully Dad will
            have assisted-living help and can be weened off his cars.
