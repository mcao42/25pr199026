Hien,

Please release (714) 280-6153 so that I can transfer it to my account, 
per my responsibility to handle his accounts.

There is a tricky thing about doing this, though.  Jessica claimed to 
Chu Y that Dad sent some sort of "sensitive" or incriminating texts to 
her.  Therefore, try to download as much of the call and text history as 
you can (but I believe it goes back only 18 months).  Only after that, 
please release the line.  Once the number is transferred to my account, 
T-Mobile tells me I cannot access past metadata.

After you release the line, I assume you want the iPhone back.  I will 
mail that to you.

I asked Dad whether he ever texted Jessica.  He said no on two different 
occasions.

Yesterday, I then explicitly said to him, "Jessica says you sent some 
sort of bad texts to her."  He replied angrily, "She is a liar."

The metadata of his texts will help prove she manufactured texts. Later, 
for court use, I will ask T-Mobile for specific metadata (which can go 
back seven years). But having informal logs now should help to determine 
if she's making up texts.

Chu Y is now on my shit list.  He expected me to believe Jessica's 
version of the story and drop the lawsuit, or be scared of a 
counterclaim.  But I simply told him, Let's see what she has for 
evidence when discovery is performed.  Chu Y spoke slowly when talking 
about "sensitive" things that will ruin Dad's reputation.  Frankly I 
don't care, I can sniff out a liar.

Thanks,
Huy
