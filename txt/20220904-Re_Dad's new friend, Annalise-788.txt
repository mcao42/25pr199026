A lot to absorb. Thanks for sharing all of what you learned via this 
email and text, Huy. Most importantly, thanks for making all the effort 
to visit with Dad. Our connection with him is very tenuous and at this 
point, it sounds like he has a weak safety net. It's very disturbing 
that he might be experiencing the onset of alzheimer. He'll need a lot 
of care for very serious health issues

H.

        I'm a bit overwhelmed from meeting Annalise today, but for the
        most part, I have a very positive impression of her and think
        this could be good for Dad.  She can be used as an emergency
        contact for Dad.  Her cell phone number is (949) 878-5116, but
        before you contact her for the first time, I recommend that you
        be introduced to her.

        Annalise is a white woman, I believe she is 80 or 81.  Her
        description of herself:

        * Peace corps volunteer in Ecuador.  She brought a whole village
        to New Jersey.

        * Math genius.  She was a businesswoman most of her life and can
        do complex calculations in her head instantly.

        * She has been healthy all her life and does not use drugs,
        whether prescription or recreational.  (This is obvious -- she
        is articulate and alert.)

        The part that's disturbing is the story she told of how Dad
        rescued her from an abusive senior home last week.  I think this
        is a true story, but I'm not sure of her interpretation of
        events.  She isn't sure how long she was there, but it sounds
        like less than two weeks.  How she got put in there is unknown
        to her.  She thinks her son's wife was behind it, but she
        doesn't know exactly.  She also mentioned a couple of times that
        certain people claim she is schizophrenic.  I can't completely
        rule this out, because some of her answers to my questions
        sounded disjointed.  She let me take a photo of the business
        card of the senior home.

        When she was there, she said two men forced injections on her
        each day.  She described it as a pink pill that was dissolved,
        then injected using a big syringe.  This made her go from
        energetic and healthy to now very achy all over her body and
        having difficulty with walking.

        Dad being a friend and former landlord, she called him and he
        came and took her out of the home.  She seems to say that this
        was possible due to the workers being on a work break.  She and
        Dad took the chance and snuck out of the senior home, not sure
        if it was early AM or late PM.

        She says she doesn't know why she was being given the treatment,
        and she was not told what the drug was for.  She says the only
        two reasons she can think of are, (1) they were trying to claim
        money from her insurance (Humana) with drug treatments, or (2)
        she was enrolled in a pharma trial without her consent.

        I don't think she made up this story, and it's clear she does
        believe it.  Leo heard her ask Dad if she could tell "about what
        happened."  She told me most of it while Dad was out of earshot,
        but she mentioned some parts of the story while we all were
        having dinner.

        She told another story over dinner, which is that her son (she
        thinks actually her daughter-in-law) is withdrawing money from
        her bank account, thousands at a time, and she and Dad will talk
        to the bank about it after Labor Day.

        Anyway, she operates at a high cognitive level, I'd say higher
        than Dad's or Mom's.  Very good-natured and well-spoken.  She
        does not come across as a gold digger at all (not that Dad has
        much gold).  She seems to genuinely care about Dad's health,
        including his diabetes.  She told me she reads 5 books every
        week.  So, I am going to send her a couple of books, so that she
        has more knowledge about nutrition and diabetes.  She wants to
        switch to a better GP for herself as well as for Dad, and
        knowing more should nudge her in the right direction when
        finding a GP.  She and I agreed on most of the basics about
        nutrition.

        There seems to be an implied boyfriend-girlfriend relationship
        between them.  So, if that lasts, it is going to be good that
        she can help Dad to improve his health.  She said to me that she
        believes he is at the onset of Alzheimer's.  I explained to her
        that this makes sense (diabetes = insulin resistance = insulin
        resistance of brain = reduced energy for brain).  She also
        brought up his snoring, apnea and narcolepsy, so she is clued-in
        about his general health issues.
