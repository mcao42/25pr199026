In addition to his physical health, his mental health issues have flared 
up considerably in recent days--anger, depression, manipulation, etc.

I kept it broad in my email to the lawyer so that the law firm can 
accommodate remote access. I don't have time to take Dad anywhere he 
commands.

I did share I need to go to LA in early March as a potential time to 
take him as needed. This calmed him down.  But it looks like no need at 
this point.

    What new serious health problem did he develop?  Or is this an old,
    serious health problem?

            Dear Karina,____

            __ __

            I am Ho Van Cao's daughter.  I am writing on behalf of my
            father who has been facing some serious health issues.  He
            is staying with me in the Bay Area to get better and will
            have difficulty making it to LA on 2/20 for the 1:1
            appointment with you.  I understand also that you have an
            examination scheduled with him on 2/23.  Can you provide
            more details?  Is it possible for this to occur in the Bay
            Area?____

            __ __

            Can we do the 2/20 meeting by zoom?  I can help him set this
            up.____

            __ __

            If absolutely needed, I have a business trip to LA the week
            of March 6 and can bring my father.____

            __ __

            Attached is a legal document that designates me and my
            brothers with power of attorney.____
