Hi Miranda,

A few follow-up items.

1. I am still unable to lookup case 30-2023-01305196-CL-UD-CJC .  Do you 
happen to have Ken's response that you can forward to me?

2. Were you able to verify that my father won't be cross-examined if he 
appears in Court just to answer our lawyer's basic questions?  He is 
very nervous about this, given his advanced mental condition.

3. The accuser, Annalise, intends to submit a signed statement regarding 
her accusations.  She will not otherwise testify nor appear in Court.  I 
will help her and my father, and pretty much understand legal rules (I 
have represented myself several times in much larger civil 
proceedings).  I will use the affidavit form, unless you think that is 
not necessary.

Please let me know, either by replying or by calling (714) 699-4447 or 
(408) 668-4440.

Best regards,
Mark

        But no luck.  In early February, I was able to find the case. 
        Any idea why I can't find it?  I am trying to see if the
        defendant ever responded to the case.____

                Hello, the filing has been received but has not been
                processed. Staffing challenges have created significant
                backlogs for these filings. At this time, I’m unable to
                give you a time estimate as to when it will be
                processed. We will try to get to it soon, thank you for
                your patience!
