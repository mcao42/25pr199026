* Car:  There should be at least one car available until September 
20th.  FYI, the Corolla should be back to Chipper before 8/20.
Street sweeping:  1st and 3rd Monday of every month between noon and 4 
PM.  Please keep that in mind to avoid a ticket.

* House:  The 4 beds, 2 baths side has been shown and has gathered some 
interest.  The other side with 2 beds, 2 baths needs a ton of work, 
including getting Jeff out (I moved him to the front room for now) and 
completely overhauling the really dirty bathroom.  We found out that 
some of the drains go to nowhere. :-(  On the bright side, the smaller 
side looks great once some of the quirky features are redone.  So for 
the long term, Dad's house will be a good income generator for him.

* Annalise has been gone 2.5 weeks.
