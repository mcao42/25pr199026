    Dear all,
    Grandpa has been in hospice for several days after three days of
    hospitalization
    I have already prepared for his last day, (cemetery, funeral home,
    ceremony with a Buddhist master ... )
    except one last thing , the white headbands for his offsprings to
    wear in your presence at the 4 hour ceremony at the funeral home,
    that I am  preparing now!
    If you can not attend his funeral due to distance, please let me
    know. I will have the head band (s) for you on the casket, ( instead
    of wearing it at the ceremony) that will go with him in cremation
    Your  heart and your thought count! Don't feel bad if you can not
    attend!
    If you have Skype i will let you talk to him , even though you can
    not understand him due to speech impairment
    We will have a very small intimate ceremony wih only close family
    members , no other guests
    Love,
    Grandma
