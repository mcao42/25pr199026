    Dear Hien Hanh Huy. I  have  just come back from the gym and read
    your email
    Right   mow, i am very very  very sad
    All in my mind is Dad wellbeing  but nothing else
    I understand Dad who has very kind heart but  he has been taking
    advantage by a lot of people, women, his relatives ….
    I regret the he did not take care of himself

    All we need to do now is not to let those things damage his life
    anymore and keep the value of  his financial assets for the rest of
    hos life

    All i am thinking now is just leave everything the way it is
    All we need to do is his well being . We respect him as long as he lives
    Dad is a decent person we should respect all of his decisions and
    leave his money and his property as long as he lives
    I pray that if his mental status improves he will be back to the Dad
    that we had before as much as possible
    If he can get out of nursing home, we will find a decent assisting
    living hime for him
    When  i lost my CADL i found Stoneridge  assisting living which
    somebdy compare it as a five star hotel
    The most important thing we need to do is to keep others from taking
    advantage of his hard earned money, until his death
    Anything left after his death will for his  children
    I can  even help with the money i have
    I do not know how long I live, can be one day , can be 50 more years
    , but i am willing to help financially. i have very little expense
    for daily life. It is very painful to see him at the hose in
    Huntinton Beach
    I do now know how long he can live
    If his living condition changes he can live longer as a decent person.
    Love,
    Mom
