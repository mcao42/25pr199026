Hi Mom,

Here are a few items to consider.

1. Did you contact the Memorial Life Insurance company to find out 
whether you can transfer the funeral contract to a buyer?  If so, you 
can add the funeral contract to your sale and increase the price.

2. Both plots have to be sold at the same time.  Hang and I were told 
that when we talked to Westminster Memorial Park in March.  So, you 
cannot split out the cemetery contract in any way.

3. The funeral contract (with American Memorial Life Insurance, paying 
to Peek) is a separate thing from your contract with Westminster 
Memorial Park.  When you talk to the life insurance company, it is about 
your funeral contract (paying Peek).  When you talk to Westminster 
cemetery, it is about the two plots which includes: (a) 2 interment 
rights for the 2 plots; (b) 2 granite markers and installation; and (c) 
2 concrete outer burial containers (OBC) and installation.  You also 
paid for travel protections for two people, but those are not refundable 
and not transferrable.

4. You (or the buyer) will pay a $500 transfer fee to Westminster 
Memorial Park.  It's easier to include this in the sale price.

5. Westminster Memorial Park recognizes you (Thanh Huynh and Ho Cao) as 
being at 10151 Crosby.  So if you try to get a sale price, you shouldn't 
use Crosby or other identifying info that they know about.

6. The sale price from the cemetery will generally be higher than yours 
(as a third party), because buyers can choose all the options they want 
instead of the options you chose, and the cemetery generally is easier 
to deal with than a private party.  You should expect to sell a bit 
lower than what the cemetery is offering.

        Hi Mom,

        Here is what I told you over the phone yesterday:

        The cemetery listing has *not* been posted yet. Nobody has seen
        it yet, except for the people who run the website.

        Any part of it can be edited at any time, including the price.

        I think what you have is only worth $22,000 in the third-party
        Marketplace. So that's what I proposed to be posted. But I said
        I could be wrong about that. And, again, nobody has seen the
        $22,000 listing yet. Because it has not been posted to the public.

        If I can help you in any way with this listing, just let me
        know, and I will provide you with the information you need. For
        now, I'm freezing the posting so the public won't see it.

        Thanks,
        Huy
