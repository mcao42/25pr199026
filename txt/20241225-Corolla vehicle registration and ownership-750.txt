Hanh,

I have been monitoring for delivery of the vehicle registration in the 
mail, and so far, it's not here.

We have our lessons learned here.  So, here's what I suggest for the 
order of things to come.

* After getting the new stickers, I will remove the Corolla from my 
Geico policy, along with removing Mom as a driver.

* I will mail to your address the stickers and title papers. At the 
same time, I will notify the DMV that Dad is no longer the owner of the 
Corolla.

Thanks,
Huy
