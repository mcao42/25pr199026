Okay, I can do this probably within a week.

The threat by Jessica, passed along by Chu Y, turns out to be comical.  
Hang and I went through all the texts on Dad's phone from Jessica as 
well as a younger woman introduced to Dad by Jessica.  Tame stuff.

Hang's Vietnamese is stronger, my English is stronger.  The texts were a 
combo of English and Vietnamese.  Here's the worst of it.

1. Dad texted to Jessica about how lonely he was without a wife, and 
that he "needed the scent of a woman," and asked Jessica if she could 
"help."  She replied no, she couldn't do that.  If that was part of her 
legal strategy, she sure didn't plan ahead well.

2. Dad did text to "insist" that the $20K (of the total of $60K) was to 
be "accepted" by Jessica.  Ambiguous language, leaving a lot of room for 
plausible deniability.  Still, that's the worst of his texts from a 
legal perspective.

3. Apparently Dad had a short sugar-daddy relationship with someone 
introduced to him by Jessica.

There is nothing there at all for a counterclaim.  I think Jessica 
cherry-picked a couple of texts to show Chu Y, which probably shocked 
him when read out of context.  The whole context of the texts is that 
Dad was lonely (in the time before he picked up Annalise) and Jessica 
was like a counsellor to him.

    You can transfer the texts to another phone. Do a backup to a

        I found his phone has complete texts for years back.  So I want
        to keep the phone till after the Jessica case is done (roughly
        Jan 1, 2024).

            Jessica claimed to Chu Y that Dad sent some sort of
            "sensitive" or incriminating texts to her.  Therefore, try
            to download as much of the call and text history as you can
            (but I believe it goes back only 18 months).  Only after
            that, please release the line.  Once the number is
            transferred to my account, T-Mobile tells me I cannot access
            past metadata.

            Y spoke slowly when talking about "sensitive" things that
