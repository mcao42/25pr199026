Okay. The more I think about it, the more I'm realizing it's very hard 
to find the perfect place. The only guarantee of decent treatment is to 
visit often and regularly so that the staff are on their toes.

    I would be visiting him more 1-2 days a week, so if you want him
    more convenient to you, I'm good with that.

    Hm

        1. Transportation.
        Free tickets for Southwest would be good!  They have good "meet
        and greet" services for wheelchair, which is what Dad will need.

        2. Living.
        Looking at a large community now at Santana Row called Bemont. 
        Around 130 residents, even includes 24-hour nursing (which most
        assisted living places don't have).  Has on-site therapy, PT, OT
        and ST, but they say Kaiser doesn't pay for it, so the sessions
        would be out of pocket.  A studio there runs for around $6K/month.

        The Yelp reviews are fine, tending to be higher than average for
        this kind of facility.  But there are some negative reviews that
        are from several years ago.  I am not sure that there are any
        perfect places out there.  There's one spot called Caring Hearts
        that has good reviews, but their availability is limited, with
        only 12 residents.

        The Belmont community would be good for good for me, as it's on
        my way to work and back home.  I figure I'll visit Dad 5-6 times
        per week, so physical location could be important.

        We could also look to Fremont and Union City as well, but that
        depends how often you plan to visit him.  Thoughts on that?

            I’m curious what you’ll find in terms of fit with Dad’s
            needs for 24/7 assisted care.

            How does air transport work?

            Btw, I have a lot of points on SWA.  Can use for you and him
            to travel.

                Fyi, I'm going to start checking these out to see if
                she's providing a quality list.

                And regarding transportation, I'm thinking air transport
                is going to be the safest and most comfortable.
