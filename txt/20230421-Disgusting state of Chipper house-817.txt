I was in the Chipper house today for about 10 minutes, but couldn't 
stand being in there.  Dad invited me to eat, and I said no thanks.

There appear to be small insects (fruit flies?) hovering over the 
trash.  The floors look like they have not been mopped in a decade.  On 
the tables and counters, things pile up, so there is not a normal empty 
area for eating.  Hallways and walkways are lined with boxes and 
furniture, making walking around hard to do.

You have to be there to believe it.  If you view pictures, it actually 
does not look bad.

The absolutely worst thing is the strong bio odor.  It gets worse and 
stronger with each visit.  The smell is unique to his house, so honestly 
I don't know what it is exactly, but Michelle seemed to think there's a 
feces component to it.

I had to drive Dad's car earlier today, so I sat where he usually sits.  
The smell (feces?) stuck to me for about an hour.
