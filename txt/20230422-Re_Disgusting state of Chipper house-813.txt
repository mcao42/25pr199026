At the time the police stopped him, he had eight containers of Ajax in 
the front row of his car. Later that day, asked him why he got so many. 
He said he is planning to clean his bathroom

            I don't know why the tenants stick around. They must be
            desperate for housing.

                I was in the Chipper house today for about 10 minutes,
                but couldn't stand being in there.  Dad invited me to
                eat, and I said no thanks.

                There appear to be small insects (fruit flies?) hovering
                over the trash.  The floors look like they have not
                been mopped in a decade.  On the tables and counters,
                things pile up, so there is not a normal empty area for
                eating.  Hallways and walkways are lined with boxes and
                furniture, making walking around hard to do.

                You have to be there to believe it.  If you view
                pictures, it actually does not look bad.

                The absolutely worst thing is the strong bio odor.  It
                gets worse and stronger with each visit.  The smell is
                unique to his house, so honestly I don't know what it is
                exactly, but Michelle seemed to think there's a feces
                component to it.

                I had to drive Dad's car earlier today, so I sat where
                he usually sits.  The smell (feces?) stuck to me for
                about an hour.
