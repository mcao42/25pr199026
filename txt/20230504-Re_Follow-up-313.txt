Hi Kim,

I've taken the liberty of CC-ing my sister.  Hanh and I have been 
communicating in detail regarding my father's condition, and we 
generally reach agreement before taking concrete steps.

This morning, I submitted a records request to the Huntington Beach PD 
regarding the prolific calls concerning my father's household over the 
last several months.  I intend to use that as one of the bases of 
requesting a TRO against Annalise Hunt on behalf of my father, which 
I'll submit ASAP.

Best regards,
Mark
