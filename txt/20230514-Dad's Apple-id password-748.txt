Please note, I had to change Dad's Apple-ID password.  I've noted the 
change in the passwords spreadsheet.

He said his old iPad "broke" and asked me to take him to Costco to get a 
new one (a cheap 64 GB model).  While setting it up, I noticed the old 
password (???????1023t) did not work, so I changed it to ???????1023! .

Seems he had not been able to read his Yahoo emails in recent weeks 
(months?).  I have made sure he can read emails on hvc_bus@yahoo.com 
<mailto:hvc_bus@yahoo.com> on his phone.  And tomorrow, I will make sure 
he can read hvc_bus@yahoo.com <mailto:hvc_bus@yahoo.com> emails on his 
new tablet.

While setting up the new iPad based on the old iPad's backed-up 
settings, the latest backup of the old iPad was stated as January 24, 
2023.  That didn't seem consistent with his statement that "the old iPad 
recently broke."

Two other things.

Although we now have power to sell his house, in my humble opinion, we 
need to be very careful how we talk to him about it.  I did not tell him 
"Your house will be sold," but rather, I told him "Maybe it's time to 
think about selling your house."

In preparing to sell his house, today I threw away about 30 pounds of 
old junk mail.  (I had to do it while he wasn't looking; he wants to 
keep even junk mail, even though he will not miss them).

On Sunday, again in prep to sell his home, I will organize his paper 
files, books, etc.  The idea is to do subtle organizing that grunts 
can't do.  After the sensitive stuff is handled such as to avoid losing 
documents, we can then hire grunts to store furniture, fix the house, etc.

Thanks,
