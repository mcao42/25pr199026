Hi Mom,

What do you think about trading the Corolla for your Honda?  You keep 
the Corolla and we will keep your car for driving to/from Orange 
County.  Then we will trade back, after you no longer want to drive anymore.

The Corolla has some pretty good safety features, like a rear-view 
camera for when you are backing up the car.
