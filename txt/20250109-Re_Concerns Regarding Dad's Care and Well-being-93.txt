If you want Dad to live vs out of the way for you to gain financially, 
then why aren't you the one asking for reassessment of hospice?? Very 
conflicting.

            You yourself were there the last time they complained about
            the expired food mom brought, around 10 days ago. I
            witnessed for myself mom putting uncovered meat into the BC
            refrigerator. I saw for myself the expired milk she gave dad
            on the week before his ER visit. Please.

            Mom can eat whatever quality food she wants for herself. But
            it is completely unacceptable to give the same to Dad when
            he is under a different medical care.

                Be very careful, Huy. You're relaying lies from people
                who have consistently gained financially from Dad being
                in his current hospice and BC arrangement.

                When hospice patients live more than 6 months and are
                doing as well as Dad has under mom's care, Dad should be
                reassesed to see if hospice is the correct course.

                I asked Maylin this several times if she can have Dad
                reassessed and have not heard an answer from you or her.
                Unacceptable.

                I've said this multiple times to you, Maylin, the BC
                staff, and Dad: I want Dad to LIVE and have a high
                quality of life. I am asking Kaiser, as his daughter, to
                reassess if hospice is appropriate. He seems to be going
                stronger than ever with the attention Mom had given him.
                He deserves much better care than he's getting currently
                which is substandard.

                Best regards,

                Hanh

                    Dear Mother and Hanh,

                    I want to address some ongoing issues concerning
                    Dad's care and well-being. It's crucial that we all
                    respect his autonomy and ensure his peace for the
                    time he has remaining.

                    _Normative Expectations:_

                    People, including the elderly, should live their
                    lives without unsolicited interference. When someone
                    appoints a Power of Attorney, it should be
                    respected, with legal avenues available for disputes
                    rather than harassment. Part of the role of the POA
                    is to protect the elder.  I do not want to exercise
                    POA powers to restrict others, but I will do so if
                    Dad's happy and health continue to be be so
                    adversely affected.

                    _Concerns:_

                    * The term "wife" should not be used by someone who
                    is legally an ex-wife, as it causes confusion and
                    disrupts Dad's peace.

                    * Financial transactions, like the payment to Elena
                    at the B&C in Castro Valley, should be examined to
                    ensure they are made legally and with Dad's best
                    interest in mind.

                    * Suggestions for Dad's care to the B&C or to
                    hospice personnel, especially regarding custody or
                    health decisions, should come from those legally
                    appointed or through proper channels.

                    * Claims of POA by a daughter whose authority has
                    been long revoked can lead to confusion and legal
                    issues.

                    * Discussions about euthanasia are highly sensitive
                    and should be approached with utmost care and
                    legality, especially coming from a daughter.

                    * Interference with professional caregivers can
                    compromise Dad's health and well-being.
                    Bringing spoiled or expired food to Dad poses high
                    health risks and should never happen again.

                    _Impact of Recent Actions:
                    _
                    The stress placed on Dad, particularly around New
                    Year's Eve, has had visible emotional and health
                    implications. His expressed wish to die following
                    these interactions is deeply concerning.

                    *Please reflect on how your actions might be
                    affecting Dad. It’s important we all work towards
                    his comfort and autonomy, not against it. While I've
                    hesitated to limit your visits, continued stress
                    might very necessitate more formal boundaries to
                    protect his health.
                    *
                    I urge you to consider the impact of your
                    involvement and strive to support Dad in ways that
                    align with his expressed wishes and medical advice.

                    Best regards,
                    Huy
