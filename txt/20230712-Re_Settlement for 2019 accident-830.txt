    Karina, the laywer, called today.  Here's what she told me.

    The medical expense is a whopping $165K.  And this is why Dad's
    share will be smaller than expected.  Dad had asked them to assure
    him that he will get a final amount of $60K.  The two sides agreed
    to that.  The $60K will come to Dad as a lump sum.

    Karina says the $250K will come almost immediately from the
    insurance company, but it could take as long as 3.5 months for the
    medical negotiation to be completed.  (If the $60K is guaranteed,
    it's a mystery why they have to wait 3+ months to cut a $60K check.)

    Karina says 2 months for the final $60K is more realistic.  I asked
    her, given Dad's current condition, shouldn't we (Dad) sign a
    beneficiary letter to avoid going to probate for the $60K.  Karina
    says drafting a beneficiary letter is not worth the trouble.  She
    didn't spell out what she meant, but I believe what she means that
    if Dad dies before the medical expenses are reduced, the law firm
    will simply cut a $60K pronto to Dad's name.  Then the beneficiary
    of one of his bank accounts would deposit the check before
    presenting the bank with the death certificate to empty all funds.

        Hien,

        Dad signed the "Release of All Claims" today.  Some details of
        what Dad will get.

        * 250K (gross)
        - minus 45% lawyer's fee on the gross
        - minus court related costs
        - minus medical expenses

        I recommended to Dad a structured settlement (annuity) rather
        than a lump sum.  Dad will be designating you as the sole
        beneficiary as soon as that is allowed, so that you wouldn't
        have to go to probate court.
