Hi Hanh,

I am seeing that Dad's car insurance will be expiring on Sep 19th.  That 
includes three cars (Mom's as well; and Mom didn't want to share an 
insurance policy with Dad anymore).  The annual cost is high, something 
like $3,700, so probably I should drop insurance as well sell both cars 
before 9/19.
