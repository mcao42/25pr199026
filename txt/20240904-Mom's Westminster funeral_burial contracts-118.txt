Mom,

Here is a collection of all of the information about the Westminster 
Memorial Park funeral services and burial contracts. I think nobody 
remembers who paid for these, but because Mom paid for the new Hayward 
funeral arrangements, it's fairest for Mom to have all of these 
Westminster assets.

* The funeral-service contracts (both of them) are non-refundable and 
non-transferable. They are lost money.

* The cemetery contract is in Mom's name. The plots certificate is in 
both Mom's and Dad's name, but it transfers completely to Mom when Dad 
passes away. Unlike the insurance contracts, the cemetery contract is 
refundable and transferable. The refund amount is very low, though.  
Therefore, the best course of action is to sell (transfer) the cemetery 
contract to a buyer. This can be done either in Mom's lifetime or later.

* I have all the printed paperwork. I probably should not be the one to 
keep these papers, since the assets belong to Mom, while I am Dad's POA.

Thanks,
Huy
