Hi Hanh,

We dropped off the Corolla at Mom's house for her use as long as she 
wants/needs it.  Mainly, it has a rear camera that's a great safety feature.

Here are a few other details so that we together can help Mom to use and 
maintain this car.

* Navigation:  It does not have a built-in mapping system.  Mom simply 
needs to plug in her iPhone to the lightning cable in the car, then use 
the phone's Maps program.  It takes about 15 seconds after plugging in 
the phone for it to "connect" to the car, which seems long to me, but 
otherwise it's easy and completely automatic.

* Maintenance.  The odometer is currently at 8,600 miles and just got an 
oil change using high quality synthetic oil.  So, it should not need 
much maintenance at all till the odometer reads 28,000 miles.  I think I 
can help mom with other maintenance as needed, such as tire pressure and 
air filter.
