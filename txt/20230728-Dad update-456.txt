Hi,

Ms. Jeong, Dad's case worker, called. Based on the improved lab test 
results for Dad's kidney, Doctor Pelligrino plans to discharge Dad next 
Tuesday. Cherise Pratti will arrange transportation which family pays 
(~$200). All medical equipment have been ordered from Kaiser and set up 
at B&C, incl hospital bed ($25/mo), wheelchair ($25/mo rental), commode 
for shower and toilet ($25). Dad is responsible for 10% copay.
