I found the email i sent to dad in octobet about the swa from long beach 
to oakland
Dad had more than 4 email sddresses and he got confused
Twodays ago dad called and  asked me about the upcoming trip
I told him from Friday-morning to monday morning by swa
He repeated what i said . I think  that he remembers
I usually check in online for him
We  can still Cancel the trip a few hours before the  flight
I will try to call him again and again

When i talked to him 2 days
I did tell him that h will come pnnfiofa√üddddd me
