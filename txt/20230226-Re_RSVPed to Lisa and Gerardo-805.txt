Dear Di 8,

Congratulations on Lisa and Gerado's upcoming wedding!  ðŸ¥‚

Thank you for the invitation to the wedding. Unfortunately, we are not 
able to make it but would like to wish Lisa and her fiance happiness in 
their lifetime union.

Hanh and Jeff

    Hi Di 8,

    FYI, I have RSVPed for both Mom and myself.  I let Lisa and Gerardo
    know that we cannot attend the wedding reception (but that we do
    plan to attend the engagement).

    Best regards,
    Chieu
