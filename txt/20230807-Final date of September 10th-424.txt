Dear Michelle,

This note is to let you know of my intention to have my father's 
move-out date from Sterling (15442 Columbia Lane in Huntington Beach) be 
Sunday, September 10th, 2023.

He is gaining strength faster than we expected.  This move-out plan is 
consistent with our intention to have him be closer to us in Northern 
California, where we can more effectively participate in his care.

Best regards,
Mark
