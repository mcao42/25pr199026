    Mom & Hanh,

    I came across a couple of very good health tips recently.

    For mom:

    * To increase insulin sensitivity, after exercising, wait as long as
    possible before eating carbs (mainly, sugar and fructose).  For
    example, after a walk, do not have a smoothie right away.  If you
    let your body stay in the "after exercise" (low blood-sugar state)
    until morning, then it can use all that time to increase insulin
    sensitivity.  (Source:  Dr. Ben Bikman.)

    For Hanh:

    * For doing long intermittent fasting and getting into autophagy,
    let your last meal of the day be in the morning or early afternoon
    for maximum brain benefit.  The reason is that 14-16 hours into a
    fast, CMA (Chaperone Mediated Autophagy) is activated.  For strong
    brain benefit, the brain should be in a low activity state while CMA
    is taking place.  For more info, see

    Mobeen talks about Chaperone Mediated Autophagy.
