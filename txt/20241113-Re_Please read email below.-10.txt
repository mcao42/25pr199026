    Did you intend standard time? I'm not being nitpicky, I just want to
    make sure there's no computer mistranslation of time zone.

            I would recommend meeting as soon as possible, and at a time
            that works for most people. The rest can join by Zoom if
            they cannot attend in person.

                Deyanira,

                Aplogies. I didn't see a message from you on Nov 8.  I
                have been out of the country since Nov 7 and will return
                on Nov 22.

                Would it be possible for us to arrange a time to meet
                when I am back. I am available on Wed, November 26,
                between 11a-5p PDT by phone or zoom. I would  like to
                meet with you. I am looping key family members, my
                brother, Huy Cao, and my mother, Thanh Huynh, who have
                been in frequent contact with my father, to invite them
                to this meeting.

                Thank you,

                Hanh

                    Greetings, Hanh.____

                    I hope this email finds you well. My name is
                    Deyanira Lopez, but I go by D. I am one of the MSW
                    from Redwood Hospice. I tried to reach out to you
                    via. text message on Friday (11/08) and unsure if
                    you received it. I am reaching out to you to ask if
                    you were open to attending a care conference to
                    discuss any questions or concerns you may have at
                    this time. The attendees of the care conference
                    meeting would be the Redwood hospice cares team,
                    facility staff, and family. If you are interested in
                    attending, do you mind sharing your availability for
                    this week. Ideally, we are still trying to
                    coordinate the meeting for this Thursday (11/14) in
                    the morning or late afternoon. If that doesn't work,
                    this Friday or Saturday morning or late afternoon
                    would work as well. Please let me know if you have
                    any questions or need clarification. Thank you for
                    your time. ____
