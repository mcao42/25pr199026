    I was not online. Best to text to me. I think the code expires after
    a minute.

            Password changed to Welcome1023!
            but I couldn't remove two-factor authentication. So I need
            to give the code to you.

                It’s not showing because I don’t have the new password
                to login. I have an iPad and iPad mini that I can’t do a
                factory reset on because of it.

                If you can temporarily change it to what is was for 1
                hour, I’ll do the reset and you can change it again. His
                old password was Welcome123t.

                    I tried both account.apple.com

                    I tried looking in the other left-hand sections, and
                    all are empty.

                        I'm trying to set up one of my old iPad for mom
                        to use because she has trouble reading the
                        emails on her iPhone.  The one that I'm trying
                        to set up was set up with dad's apple ID.  It
                        looks like you've changed dad's apple password.

                        Can you either provide me with his new apple
                        password or go into icloud and delete the ipad
                        from his devices so that I can complete the set
                        up for mom?

                        Please reply to let me know that it's done.
