This video describes the new science of epigenetics.

Epigenetics is basically gene expression. It's usually perfect at birth, 
but gradually degrades with each year of aging. Most of the epidemic 
chronic diseases (Alzeimers, cancer, obesity, diabetes, autism, and 
various mental illnesses) are believed by some scientists to be based in 
the same epigenetic degradation, caused by artificial (unnatural) 
environmental influences.

Removing unnatural environmental triggers and reintroducing a natural 
diet and strong natural forces, like sunlight (in a moderate amount), 
can sometimes restore epigenetics.

Building up the body is called anabolism (this happens in the time after 
eating), and repairing the body is called catabolism (this fasting 
period starts several hours after the most recent meal). Throughout most 
of human history (one million years), we dedicated most of our bodily 
energy to the repairing mode. But especially in the last 50 years, a 
large portion of the human population have spent very little time in the 
repair mode. That fact has caused an epidemic of chronic diseases.

And this is why various medical modalities seem to reverse aging. They 
simply restore natural mechanisms of repair that are similar to fasting. 
These medical interventions include

* sunlight
* near-infrared light therapy
* fasting
* low carbohydrate diet
* vegetable diet (which is a moderate carbohydrate diet)
* certain medications, like metformin, that simulate fasting states
* certain supplements, like resveratrol, that accelerate epigenetic repair
