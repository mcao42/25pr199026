Hi Mark,
Absolutely not too early to look. In fact, it's advised you secure a 
room prior to discharge. Give me a call when you are free to chat 
(925)495-0330. Our Senior Living Advisors answer the phones until 8 
o'clock.

Hi Christine,

I was recommended to you for my father who is recovering from an acute 
stroke.

I would like for him to be placed to a new B&C, preferably in Fremont, 
starting around Sunday, September 10th. Is it too early to start looking?
