Hi Dad.  I emailed this to Hanh and Hien.

Hanh and Hien,

Please note the following changes to Dad's trust:

* 1st successor trustee changes to Huy, to match the Power Of Attorney 
(POA) appointment currently active.

* Other non-financial assignments, such as for advance health care 
directive, remain the same.

* Looks like Dad wants to remove Mom as an inheritor.  (He definitely 
does not intend to replace her with anyone else.)  However, Dad wants to 
think about this some more.

* Dad wants to leave the Chipper property to me only, preferably by 
transferring the property even before death.

Regarding the last point, Dad's initial thought was that the property 
needs to be gifted soon to avoid possible liquidation by the public 
guardian.  I assured Dad that the investigator already expressed she is 
happy with the POA appointment to a family member.  Dad then expressed 
that he still wants to do this, for the good job I am currently doing to 
prepare his HB home as well as for addressing his physical needs.

Dad has been meaning to call you to inform you, to avoid a surprise 
later, but I will suggest that he just email to you about his wishes, as 
that might be easiest for him.

Thanks,
Huy
