I would text him starting with "Hi Dad, it's Hanh" just in case you're 
not in his contacts list.  Hopefully that attracts his attention.

Then about five days before your visit, I'd text him again, followed by 
a couple of call attempts.  I think there is no point in leaving a 
voicemail.

It is very hit and miss.  It seems he doesn't pay attention to phone 
notifications.  But if he hears the phone ring, he probably tries to 
check out who called.

If you do not reach him, just visit anyway.  Let him know you tried to 
reach him but couldn't.  Once you're there, take him out for a 
Vietnamese meal, which is what he likes doing.

So as I mentioned, I am there every weekend.

There are lots of tasks to do, and lots of tips for interacting with him 
(and with Annalise if she's tagging along).  If you are staying for more 
than one day, the place is livable now so you can be there overnight if 
you want to save on hotel.  The bad stink is gone (there's a lingering 
odor, probably Jeff the smoker).  Just let me know what your plan is and 
how long you'll be there, and I can give you more info then.

Thanks,
Huy

    Dad's not easy to communicate with, so suggestions welcomed on how
    to contact him to get a response.

        You can visit anytime at all. Just try to give that advance
        notice to Dad.  Driving now, I will give you more details later

            Are you there with Dad full time, Huy?

            I can visit Dad and help with whatever is needed 7/27-7/28
            and 9/30-10/1.

            Will that work for Dad and you?

                Best thing you can do for starters is to visit him every
                couple months. I think he's lonely and that's one of the
                reasons he keeps annalise around. There's zero
                effectiveness helping him either financially or long
                distance.

                    Thanks for the updates, Huy.  I’m just getting
                    through an intensive period of wrapping up my job
                    and will leave at the end of the month.  What help
                    do you need?

                        The Chipper house is nearly ready for rental to
                        a family (four bedrooms, two baths; Dad will
                        keep two bedrooms, two baths and a
                        kitchenette).  Ken is out and Jeff is currently
                        being court evicted.  The two biggest remaining
                        problems for Dad are:

                        1. He keeps driving.  In fact, he caused a minor
                        accident just yesterday.

                        2. Annalise.  Or more precisely, she is easy to
                        get out of the house, but Dad has been undecided
                        about her fate.  Therefore she keeps getting
                        permitted back in the house.

                        I think I can convince Annalise to move out in
                        the August timeframe.  By September 1st, there
                        should be a new rental lease starting.  Starting
                        in September, hopefully Dad will have
                        assisted-living help and can be weened off his cars.
