Greetings, Hanh,

Thank you for your communication. I apologize the meeting wasn’t 
scheduled at the time you provided. 1 PM (Pacific-Time) worked for 
majority of the participants (Redwood hospice care team, facility staff, 
and family). A care conference was introduced to review and discuss any 
concerns or questions family may have. The goal is to have an 
understanding on how to proceed moving forward and have 
questions/concerns addressed. I will provide a link on a separate email 
shortly. Thank you kindly.

Respectfully,
