    No video. Video sometimes creates  bandwidth problems that affect
    audio quality.

        So it's a conference call and not by video yes?

                        Hien and Hanh,

                        I spoke again to Michelle Nguyen, the Adult
                        Protective Services social worker.  She
                        reiterated that she wanted to do a conference
                        call with all of us.

                        1. I am guessing that Thursday would be the best
                        day to book something.  My schedule is flexible,
                        so I just need to know what would work for both
                        of you.

                        And when talking to her:

                        2. We should offer her documentation, as it
                        seems her investigative scope is limited.

                        3. IMO, we should let her know our intention of
                        suing for conservatorship.  This then should put
                        her in a mode of thinking of (a) supporting it,
                        (2) giving helpful tips (perhaps even attorney
                        names), and (3) sharing her experience of when a
                        conservatorship makes the most sense.

                        Thanks,
                        Huy
