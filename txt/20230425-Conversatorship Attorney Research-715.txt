Huy,

I was fine looking up reviews of those on Michelle's list.

Initial criteria:  I was inclined to NOT select lawyers in posh towns 
like Newport Beach and Laguna HIlls (high overhead).  I ended up looking 
up those in Santa Ana and Orange.

I selected 3 with top ratings/reviews (saved in the 
DAD/conservatorship/attorneys director in this Attorney Research 
<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rcxZZOz6-Wj7qCAZItZ1udxVit-bKu--DEjuGtndaig/edit#gid=0>google 
doc.

Interestingly, I looked up the lawyer that Dad chose for his will & 
trust.  It turns out that James Roberts was also on Michelle's list.  I 
found this law firm really nice when Dad had me go through the Zoom 
family day to learn about how a will & trust works.  He might be 
amenable to using someone he trusts.

I noticed that if we go through the avvo.com <http://avvo.com> site, we 
can message the law firm to set up a consultation.  We might do that 
rather than call for efficiency.
