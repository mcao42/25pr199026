Warm-ups:
* Go to dinner with Dad.  Don't exclude annalise if they want her to 
come along.
* Talk to him about his favorite subjects, like food and kicking out Ken.
* Have him sign the Unlawful Detainer papers.

POA persuasion:
* Generally:  Play dumb, to lower his guard.  Blame the public guardian 
on Michelle.  Blame Michelle on the neighbors or perhaps on the police.
* Let him bring up the public guardian.  Try to make him believe POA is 
his idea.  Explain to him the difference between Hanh, the trustee 
versus Hanh, the successor trustee.
    - Leave open signing the POA today, but put on soft pressure for 
now.  The hard pressure to sign POA should be over the weekend.
    - Means of selling the POA idea:  (1) Bring up "revocable," but only 
if absolutely needed.  (2) Steer him away from imposing conditions on 
the POA contract.  (3) Let him know a copy of the signed POA will be 
sent promptly to the pub guardian.
* Hard tactics today, only if he's teetering and ready to sign:  If 
needed, give him anxiety about the IRS looking into his business.  Tell 
him the police are scrutinizing his home and his driving.

Miscellaneous:
* Get a feel for how serious he is about selling the house.  Encourage 
him to feel that selling the HB home will permanently get rid of the 
public guardian.
    - Warn him against selling the home on his own.  Tell him that we 
will hire competent tax advisors to get him the best outcome.
* Talk to Annalise about it being a no-no to call the police on Dad.  
Warm her up to the TRO, but avoid talking about the TRO if possible.
