        Good lesson learned here.  His traveling doesn't sound like a
        good idea at all.

            I'm recovering from Covid, so not 100%, but based on my
            visit with him in Oct, it's clear that Dad had undergone
            severe decline--physically and cognitively. He can barely
            use his iphone or log into his email or other critical
            accounts. He's confused about his passwords no matter how
            many times we go through the info.

            He cannot manage his affairs. He'll need support to keep his
            house and manage his health. If he refuses, he may end up
            homeless or incapacitated.

            That's the conversation we need to have with him.

            Do you think he understands enough to fly to Oakland, Mom?

            H.

                He can’t take his phone to T-Mobile? Maybe Hanh can take
                him to T-Mobile on Saturday when he’s here.
