It is very painful for me to think about it
I am not the kind to deal with such people
The truck is 3 times bigger than my car
The driver is a strong mexican laborer
That truck hit the passenger of  my car  damage to the trick is not much
After the accident he ran all ovet  across  the street.  Tme for him to 
get a fortune
Do we need a lawyer
Please take care of it. I accept any of your decision

    Amber just called me about the same query of the attached PDF.  She
    was very friendly and cheerful (different from the formal letter's
    tone).

    * She said Geico was contacted by the other side's lawyer.
    * The lawyer disclosed that the client is going to a chiropractor
    for injuries.
    * The lawyer wants to know the Geico limits for compensation.  That
    is $50K.
    * That information ($50K) has not yet been disclosed to the lawyer.
    They need your permission first before they can do so.
    * The extent of injuries and damage award is not known until
    the therapy sessions have finished. But she told me (obviously
    informally) that $50K should cover that kind of therapy.
    * Referring to the letter, it looks like I am the one who should
    sign the letter. So, I need to know how you want to proceed.

    In my limited experience, the other side would like to know the
    limit so they can ask for that amount and no more. You should
    research to make your own decision.
