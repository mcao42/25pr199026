Huy,

Thank you for the cc.  FYI the email was addressed to Hang, rather than 
Hanh.  I forwarded it this morning.

    To Ms. Huynh and Ms. Yu:

    Geico called me this morning, stating that they received the San
    Jose PD police report about the car collision of 12/16/2024.

    Attached are two letters. One is from December, but I am attaching
    it for your records in case you never downloaded it.

    The second letter is dated 2/14/2025. It is time-sensitive.  It is
    important you review it.  I am CCing Jeff Yu, who has been less
    selective with email replies, to make sure that Ms. Huynh receives
    this important letter.

    Cordially,
    Mark Cao
