Mom is still tied to dad for a lot of things like car insurance, AAA, 
taxes, etc. We should figure out what all the links are and help her 
sever those links/dependencies. The day is coming when she needs to have 
her own solution to all those items.

        Hi Mark, your Dad seems to be exhibiting signs of Alzheimer's.
        Some days he seems okay, but other days he's really out of it!
        That's my observation. Also he brought back that woman,
        Annalise, who your Dad told police several weeks ago that she
        has Dementia. And both last night and tonight she left a burner
        on, on the kitchen stove after she had gone to bed. I discovered
        that when I went into the kitchen around 10PM tonight and about
        the same time last night. She never cleans anything and leaves
        all the pots and pans and dishes dirty. Your Dad used to keep
        everything clean and also clean the kitchen table after he ate,
        but he no longer does that. Elise everything a mess, which he
        did not used to do! Question: Do you have Power of Attorney over
        your Dad? He appears as if he is becoming incompetent and
        Analise's dementia and forgetfulness is becoming a danger to the
        safety of everyone
          here as well as to this property! The shrubs and weeds on the
        side of the house are all overgrown. I would trim it myself but
        your dad has no tools to do that. So again do you have power of
        attorney? Thanks! Ken Van Natta
