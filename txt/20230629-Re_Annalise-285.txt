Thanks for the updates, Huy.  Iâ€™m just getting through an intensive 
period of wrapping up my job and will leave at the end of the month.  
What help do you need?

    The Chipper house is nearly ready for rental to a family (four
    bedrooms, two baths; Dad will keep two bedrooms, two baths and a
    kitchenette).  Ken is out and Jeff is currently being court
    evicted.  The two biggest remaining problems for Dad are:

    1. He keeps driving.  In fact, he caused a minor accident just
    yesterday.

    2. Annalise.  Or more precisely, she is easy to get out of the
    house, but Dad has been undecided about her fate.  Therefore she
    keeps getting permitted back in the house.

    I think I can convince Annalise to move out in the August
    timeframe.  By September 1st, there should be a new rental lease
    starting.  Starting in September, hopefully Dad will have
    assisted-living help and can be weened off his cars.
