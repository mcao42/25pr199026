*If you do not plan to travel on your flight:* In accordance with 
Southwest's No-Show Policy, if you are not planning to travel on any 
portion of this itinerary, please cancel your reservation at least 10 
minutes prior to the scheduled departure time of your flight. Any 
Customer who fails to cancel reservations for a Wanna Get Away® or Wanna 
Get Away Plus™ fare segment at least ten (10) minutes prior to the 
scheduled departure time and who does not board the flight will be 
considered a no-show, and all remaining unused Wanna Get Away or Wanna 
Get Away Plus funds will be forfeited. All remaining unused Business 
Select® or Anytime funds will be converted to a flight credit. If you 
no-show for your reward travel reservation, the points will be 
redeposited to the purchaser's Rapid Rewards® account. Any taxes and 
fees associated with your reward travel reservation will be held for 
future use in the form of a flight credit. *Starting July 1, 2023 (12:00 
a.m. CT),* for Wanna Get Away® or Wanna Get Away Plus™ reward 
travel reservations (booked with points): If you do not cancel your 
reservation at least 10 minutes before the flight’s original scheduled 
departure time, any points used for booking will be forfeited, along 
with any taxes and fees associated with your reward 
travel reservation. For Anytime or Business Select® reward travel 
reservations: the points used for booking will be redeposited to the 
purchaser's Rapid Rewards® account, and any taxes and fees associated 
with the reward travel reservation will be converted into a Transferable 
Flight Credit™ for future use.

*Prohibition on Multiple/Conflicting Reservations:* to promote seat 
availability for our Customers, Southwest® prohibits multiple 
reservations for the same Passenger departing from the same city on the 
same date, or any multiple reservations containing conflicting or 
overlapping itineraries (such as departures for the same Customer from 
multiple cities at the same time). Furthermore, without advance notice 
to the Passenger or purchaser, Southwest may cancel such reservations, 
or any other reservations that it believes, in its sole discretion, were 
made without intent to travel. With the exception of Southwest gift 
cards, funds from proactively canceled reservations by Southwest will be 
returned to the original form of payment. Reservations paid for with a 
Southwest gift card will have the amount applied from the gift card held 
as a flight credit for use by the Customer on a future Southwest 
Airlines® flight.
