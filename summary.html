            <h2>DMV Issues Following Dad's Dementia Diagnosis</h2>
            <p>The siblings handle the implications of their father's driving restrictions following his dementia diagnosis. Hien explains that California law requires Dr. Datta to report their father's condition to the Department of Public Health, which will notify the DMV. Though they don't believe their father currently has a valid driver's license, they discuss the process for responding to any DMV paperwork. Hien observes that their father predominantly uses one laptop for watching pornography, which leads to a thread of family messages about their father's long-standing inappropriate habits. Their mother (Thanh) confirms this behavior has been ongoing since the children were young, describing it as "a disease" and "compulsive" alongside gambling tendencies. These exchanges reveal both practical concerns about their father's driving safety and deeply personal family history affecting their caregiving dynamics.</p>

Mark provides updates about the legal process, noting that while Ken didn't respond to the court filing within the allowed timeframe, the courts might still allow a delayed response. Mark explains that even with a default judgment, it could take until late March for the sheriff to physically remove the tenant. On February 12, their father announces his plan to return permanently to Huntington Beach after a February 18 trip with Mark. He intends to negotiate directly with Ken for February and March rent payments and a March end-date for tenancy. This decision surprises his children, who had been working to bring him to the Bay Area permanently due to health concerns. The situation highlights tensions between their father's desire for independence and his children's concern for his wellbeing.</p>

Ken Van Natta, a tenant whom the family had been trying to evict, sends concerning messages to Mark about their father's mental state and problematic situations with Annalise. Ken reports that their father is showing signs of Alzheimer's, with good and bad days, and that Annalise has returned to the house despite earlier allegations against her. Ken describes serious safety concerns including Annalise leaving burners on at night and poor household cleanliness. The siblings discuss this situation, with Hien noting their father's erratic behavior, including making multiple urgent phone calls about trivial matters like a T-Mobile account. Mark attempts to dismiss both the eviction case against Ken and a restraining order their father had filed, but their father later cancels these legal remedies, showing his inconsistent decision-making. The situation reflects the challenging intersection of their father's declining cognitive capacity and his insistence on managing rental properties independently.</p>

            <p>Mark provides a detailed report after visiting their father's home in Huntington Beach from March 11-14. His observations confirm serious concerns about their father's living situation and mental capacity. The house is in poor condition with excessive clutter, bio odors, and unhygienic conditions. Mark notes he was able to end both the eviction case against Ken and their father's restraining order request, temporarily reducing legal entanglements. However, he describes a complex, dysfunctional dynamic between their father, Annalise, and tenants Ken and Jeff. During the visit, Mark learns that their father's driver's license appears to be suspended, though their father still drives and has been in car accidents. Mark also meets with Chu Y (a family advisor), who strongly recommends consulting with an Elder Care Financial Planner and warns about potential severe consequences if their father is caught driving without a license, including property seizure to fund state-mandated care. The report reveals that Mark attempted to initiate a 60-day eviction notice for tenants, but their father quickly canceled it, showing his inconsistent decision-making and resistance to help despite his declining capacity to manage his affairs.</p>

            <p>Mark manages complex negotiations with Ken, the tenant at their father's Huntington Beach property. Ken attempts to use his medical condition as leverage to delay eviction and extract financial concessions. Mark shares his email to Ken requesting documentation of medical needs and questioning Ken's demand for $5,000 to vacate the property, characterizing this as potentially extortionary. Mark explains to his siblings that Ken is employing a strategy frequently used in California, positioning himself as a disabled person requiring accommodation, which complicates the eviction process due to legal protections for vulnerable tenants. This situation highlights the challenges the family faces in managing their father's property affairs while dealing with difficult tenants who understand how to navigate tenant protection laws.

            <p>Mark shares increasingly concerning updates about their father's living situation in Huntington Beach. Based on communications with Ken (the tenant), Mark reports that their father's household has become chaotic, with frequent police visits and confusing legal actions. Their father appears to have continued pursuing a restraining order against Ken despite earlier cancelation, though the judge denied it. Mark describes Annalise as "basically running the house" and manipulating their father, while creating a hostile environment for the other tenants. Multiple police calls to the house suggest escalating tensions, and there are indications that their father's car may have been involved in an accident or impounded. Mark emphasizes his concern that without intervention, the situation could quickly deteriorate to the point where authorities might initiate a 5150 psychiatric hold (involuntary mental health assessment). This period demonstrates the accelerating decline in their father's living conditions and decision-making capacity, creating safety risks for himself and others.</p>

The family discusses how to frame these concerns to APS effectively, with Thanh (their mother) advising them to present information objectively rather than accusatorily, emphasizing concern for their father's wellbeing while letting social workers investigate the details. Hanh adds documentation about their father's February memory assessment and formal dementia diagnosis, including the doctor's written recommendations against driving and for accepting help with healthcare and financial decisions.

Liz suggests calling the DMV to report driving concerns and contacting the "Office of the Public Guardian OC" for help with conservatorship. Mark emphasizes to his siblings that they need to present a strong case to APS to prompt meaningful action, noting that APS workers typically seek the "least restrictive means" of resolving issues and will only escalate interventions if they perceive significant risk. The family debates strategy, with some members preferring a less confrontational approach while Mark advocates for presenting detailed concerns to ensure APS fully recognizes the severity of the situation.

Mark suggests their father's primary motivations are maintaining his relationship with Annalise and preserving the comfort of his familiar environment, despite the deteriorating conditions. Mark proposes a potential approach of offering their father a compromise where they wouldn't actively exclude Annalise from his life, hoping this would make him more amenable to accepting a conservatorship. The siblings debate whether this would be a productive strategy, with Hanh expressing skepticism that their father would cooperate with conservatorship under any conditions. She notes that either allowing their father to continue in his current unsafe situation or imposing a conservatorship against his will are both difficult options with no ideal solution.

            <p>Mark encounters a critical situation while visiting the Huntington Beach area. He follows his father, who is driving despite his suspended license, and observes concerning behavior including freeway driving, napping in the car, and disoriented navigation. After witnessing his father driving very slowly in a parking lot, Mark calls 911 to report a dangerous unlicensed driver. Two Santa Ana police officers respond and interact with both Mark and his father. The officers note that while they believe Mark's report about the invalid license, they don't observe immediately dangerous driving behavior. They advise Mark to pursue emergency conservatorship and include police records in the application. During the encounter, Mark maintains a cover story with his father about coincidentally being in the area for legal research, though his father is surprised by Mark's sudden appearance. This incident provides concrete evidence of their father's continued unsafe driving despite medical directives and license suspension, adding urgency to the family's intervention efforts.</p>

            <h2>Deteriorating Living Conditions at Dad's Home</h2>
            <p>Mark provides disturbing details about the conditions in their father's Huntington Beach home after a brief visit. He describes a severely unhygienic environment with fruit flies hovering over trash, unmopped floors, excessive clutter blocking walkways, and a pervasive "bio odor" that gets worse with each visit. Mark reports being unable to stay in the house for more than 10 minutes due to the smell, which social worker Michelle suspected might have a feces component. Even more concerning, this odor was also present in their father's car and transferred to Mark when he drove it. The family discusses these observations, with Hanh expressing surprise that tenants would remain in such conditions and Thanh noting that the documented poor conditions actually strengthen their case for intervention. This evidence of severe household neglect provides concrete support for the family's concerns about their father's inability to maintain safe living conditions, reinforcing the need for formal intervention.</p>

            <h2>Conservatorship Attorney Research and Strategy</h2>
            <p>Following their conference call with APS social worker Michelle Nguyen, the siblings begin researching elder law attorneys who could assist with a conservatorship filing. Michelle provides a list of recommended attorneys, and Hanh conducts detailed research on potential legal representation, creating a spreadsheet comparing options based on reviews and locations. Interestingly, she discovers that James Roberts, the attorney who previously helped their father create his will and trust, is also on Michelle's recommended list. Hanh suggests this attorney might be a good option since their father already knows and trusts him. The family also discusses potential financial resources for legal consultation through their employers' legal service plans, with Hanh noting that both her work plan and her husband Jeff's plan offer elder law consultation and potential discounts for conservatorship proceedings. This methodical approach to securing legal representation demonstrates the family's commitment to pursuing formal intervention through proper legal channels rather than continuing to manage increasingly dangerous situations informally.</p>

            <h2>Intervention Plan Development</h2>
            <p>Mark outlines a direct intervention approach to address their father's situation. His plan involves informing their father that Michelle (the APS social worker) has shared serious concerns about his wellbeing and has applied for a public guardian, which would likely result in loss of both financial and individual freedom, including potential separation from Annalise. Mark proposes presenting an alternative: voluntarily activating the Living Will to cede Power of Attorney to Hanh, which would preserve more of their father's autonomy while allowing the family to help sell his house and move him to a new living situation in the Bay Area. While Mark anticipates initial resistance, he suggests their father may reconsider when faced with the reality of public guardian involvement. Hanh approves this approach, acknowledging that while neither option is ideal, the intervention is necessary for their father's safety. This strategic planning shows the family moving from information gathering to active intervention after months of watching their father's situation deteriorate despite their attempts to provide support from a distance.</p>

            <p>Mark visits Huntington Beach to implement the intervention plan with their father. During this visit, he has direct interactions with Annalise, confirming many of the family's concerns. Mark describes her as having poor cognitive skills but high emotional intelligence, allowing her to manipulate their father despite their strained relationship. He notes their father is acutely aware of Annalise's substantial Social Security check, suggesting financial motivation in the relationship. The visit includes breakfast with both their father and Annalise, during which Mark presents information about a potential public guardianship. Later, Mark witnesses a police encounter at the house, where officers express exasperation about frequent calls to the residence (at least weekly), which has drawn attention from the police department, city council, fire department, and code enforcement. The officers advise Mark to pursue emergency conservatorship and include police records as supporting evidence. This visit represents the family's most direct intervention attempt, confronting both their father and the chaotic household dynamics that have developed as his cognitive abilities have declined.</p>

            <h2>Escalating Situation with Annalise and Continued Intervention Efforts</h2>
            <p>The family's concerns about their father's relationship with Annalise intensify in early May. In a series of detailed emails, Mark describes meeting with his father and Annalise for breakfast, where he presented information about the potential involvement of a public guardian. He observes that Annalise has poor comprehension but responds to almost everything with irrelevant anecdotes about her own life. Mark notes that his father seems primarily interested in Annalise's substantial Social Security income ($3,500+ monthly) despite their strained relationship and frequent annoyance with each other. Hanh expresses her belief that their father's judgment is being blinded by financial greed related to Annalise, while also lamenting that he seems unconcerned about his health. The siblings debate whether continued intervention is worthwhile if their father refuses help, with Mark outlining three possible scenarios: allowing their father to continue making his own poor decisions, having a public guardian take over (which would drain resources quickly), or pursuing family conservatorship (which would preserve resources but face resistance). This exchange reflects the family's growing frustration and ethical dilemma about how far to push intervention when faced with persistent resistance.</p>

            <p>Mark develops a strategy to secure Power of Attorney (POA) from their father as an alternative to public guardianship. He proposes presenting their father with both Durable POA and Limited POA options, with a preference for the more comprehensive Durable POA. Hanh expresses support for this approach and suggests Mark should be the designated agent due to his ongoing involvement with their father's case. Mark notes that their father seems more trusting of Hanh for this role, possibly due to suspicion that Mark is behind his recent problems. The siblings discuss timing and approach for presenting these options, with Kim (Deputy Public Guardian) providing important background information. When meeting with their father, Kim left an informational fact sheet about public guardianship which apparently caused their father significant anxiety. The siblings strategize using this anxiety constructively to encourage their father to accept family help rather than state intervention. This period shows the siblings carefully coordinating their approach while navigating their father's suspicions and resistance.</p>

When reminded about a specific May 1st incident, their father becomes angry at Annalise and tells her to move out, though his anger quickly subsides. Mark also helps their father with eviction paperwork against tenant Ken and observes that Annalise and their father have a strange, financially motivated relationship with mutual annoyance. Further complicating matters, Mark learns that Annalise had been telling their father the public guardian was a free volunteer service, directly contradicting the information Mark was providing. Mark plans a weekend strategy focusing on rebuilding their father's fear of the public guardian as leverage while also managing the immediate concerns of tenant eviction.

The changes include making Mark the first successor trustee (replacing Hanh), potentially removing their mother as an inheritor, and their father's wish to leave the Huntington Beach property to Mark alone, possibly through pre-death transfer. Mark explains that their father initially wanted to gift the property soon to avoid liquidation by the public guardian, though Mark assured him this was unnecessary given the successful POA arrangement. Nevertheless, their father insisted on making these changes, citing Mark's extensive efforts to improve the house and address his physical needs. This announcement triggers a strong negative reaction from Hien, who accuses Mark of working toward this outcome all along for personal financial gain, while Mark defends his actions as being focused on their father's care rather than inheritance.

Mark finds documentation indicating the transaction date and bank account but not the amount, along with a note stating the transaction was intended as a gift.

            <h2>Increasing Concerns About Annalise</h2>
            <p>Tensions escalate regarding their father's relationship with Annalise, with Mark sharing increasingly worrying observations. In an alarming development, Mark reports that during a brief moment when he left the table to pay a restaurant bill, Annalise immediately asked their father about the financial implications of marriage, inquiring specifically about "how that affects my security." Mark describes their father as lonely, suggesting this is why he maintains the relationship despite its problems. When Hanh offers to visit their father, Mark encourages this, noting their father needs more regular family contact. However, the situation grows more complicated when Mark shares that Annalise is "out-foxing" their father, and later, that she's trying to marry him which would "really complicate things." Mark provides troubling background information that Annalise has used different names in the past and has made inconsistent statements about her marital history. This period shows the relationship with Annalise evolving from problematic roommate to potential financial predator, increasing the urgency of family intervention.</p>

            <h2>Beneficiary Designations and Inheritance Disputes</h2>
            <p>A significant conflict emerges among the siblings regarding beneficiary designations and inheritance expectations. Mark asks Hanh and Hien to clarify whether they are willing to serve as trustees and beneficiaries for their father's estate, revealing that Hanh had previously texted him expressing a preference that both she and Hien be removed as beneficiaries. Hanh confirms this request, stating she prefers Mark be the beneficiary since he's doing all the work to care for their father. Hien initially responds with anger, accusing Mark of manipulating the situation for financial gain, writing "This is what you wanted all along" and suggesting Mark will eventually go after their mother's assets too. Mark responds defensively, emphasizing that he cannot make these decisions for financial motivations given their mother has more assets than their father. Mark later informs his siblings that he has told their father about Hanh's decision to be removed as beneficiary, noting their father's feelings did not seem hurt, and that in the event of their father's death before paperwork changes are finalized, Hanh should transfer any inherited assets to Hien. This exchange reveals deep tensions and mistrust among the siblings regarding financial matters and perceptions of caretaking motivations.</p>

            <h2>Settlement for 2019 Accident</h2>
            <p>Mark shares information about a significant legal settlement their father has received from a 2019 accident. Their father signs a "Release of All Claims" document for a $250,000 gross settlement, though the final amount will be substantially reduced by a 45% lawyer's fee, court costs, and medical expenses. Mark recommends their father choose a structured settlement (annuity) rather than a lump sum and notes that their father plans to designate Hien as the sole beneficiary to avoid probate complications. In follow-up communication, Mark shares new information from the lawyer Karina that medical expenses amount to approximately $165,000, much higher than anticipated, resulting in a net payment to their father of only about $60,000. This leads Hanh to question why medical expenses are so high when their father is covered by Kaiser, with Mark suggesting it might be "an attorney scheme that legit doctors don't participate in." The timing of the settlement distribution remains uncertain, with estimates ranging from two to three and a half months for final payment, creating potential concerns about what would happen if their father were to die before disbursement. This settlement provides their father with some additional resources while highlighting the complexity and potential exploitation in the personal injury legal system.</p>

            <h2>Dad's Stroke and Hospitalization</h2>
            <p>The family faces a medical crisis when their father suffers a stroke, leading to hospitalization and dramatically changing his condition. CT scans reveal a blood clot, resulting in significant physical and cognitive impairments. Mark reports that their father now has very poor verbal communication skills, much weaker control of the right side of his body, incontinence issues, apparent discomfort, signs of depression, and diminished cognitive abilities. Medical staff, including a PT and occupational therapist, evaluate him to develop a rehabilitation plan, with the case manager exploring options for transfer to a skilled nursing facility. Hanh expresses concern about the impact of stroke on their father's already compromised cognitive function, noting CT scan results showing "extensive hypoattenuation in the periventricular white matter" which suggests increased likelihood of progression from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. The siblings coordinate closely with medical staff regarding transfer options, with particular concern about the challenges of outpatient rehabilitation given their father's lack of support in Orange County. This medical crisis introduces a new, more urgent dimension to the ongoing family caregiving challenges.</p>

Mark focuses on completing beneficiary designations, particularly assigning Hien as beneficiary for most assets, and notes he is avoiding revising the Living Trust during their father's illness out of respect for his previously expressed intentions. Mark also addresses healthcare directives, reminding Hien of his responsibility as the primary healthcare agent, emphasizing that decisions should align with their father's wishes and values. Additionally, Mark provides updates on legal actions their father had initiated, including the case against Jessica Cao and potential action against family member Vui. He expresses reluctance to pursue the case against Vui due to limited documentation and the relatively small amount involved.

            <p>A significant family conflict erupts during a hospital visit to their father. Mark sends a late-night email expressing frustration with Hanh's behavior during their joint visit. He reports that Dr. Pellegrino informed him that their father's average life expectancy, given his condition, is approximately one remaining year. Mark claims he conveyed this information carefully to Hanh, but alleges she then bluntly told their father "the doctor says you have a year left," which Mark found extremely offensive. The situation further deteriorated when, according to Mark, Hanh promised their father she would visit him every remaining day of his life even if he stayed in Orange County, a commitment Mark finds unrealistic, especially if their father lives beyond the average expectancy. Mark expresses concern about Hanh's promise creating expectations their father will remember despite his condition, and suggests Hanh and Hien need to formalize in writing that Hanh will transfer inherited assets to Hien, doubting she would honor such a transfer after years of daily visits. Mark states he won't initiate changes to paperwork while their father is weak but characterizes the situation as "a train wreck waiting to happen" between his siblings. This confrontational exchange reveals deep tensions about care responsibilities, inheritance, and communication styles during their father's health crisis.</p>

            <h2>Family Dynamics Throughout Father's Decline</h2>
            <p>The first half of 2023 reveals increasingly complex and sometimes strained family dynamics as the siblings navigate their father's cognitive decline and living situation. Initially, the siblings collaborate on managing their father's healthcare, with Hien creating password spreadsheets, Hanh coordinating medical appointments, and Mark addressing property issues. However, as intervention becomes more urgent due to their father's unsafe living conditions and tenant problems, roles become more distinct. Mark takes on the most active, hands-on role, making frequent visits to Huntington Beach, directly confronting problematic tenants, and eventually securing Power of Attorney. Communication styles differ significantly among siblings, with Mark preferring direct intervention while Hanh and Hien often favor more cautious approaches. Tensions emerge around financial matters, particularly after their father expresses a desire to leave his Huntington Beach property solely to Mark, leading to accusations about motives. Their father's stroke in July 2023 accelerates these dynamics, creating new urgency around care decisions while exacerbating existing conflicts about inheritance and care responsibilities. Throughout this period, their mother Thanh occasionally provides advice from her perspective as their father's former spouse, offering strategic guidance while maintaining some emotional distance from the situation. These evolving dynamics demonstrate how the stress of elder care can both strengthen family collaboration and expose underlying tensions.</p>

            <p>Following their father's stroke, the siblings address the critical issue of healthcare decision-making authority. Mark drafts a new Advanced Healthcare Directive to replace Hien as the primary healthcare agent, in line with their father's alleged wishes. Mark shares the document with Hanh, who reviews it and suggests he coordinate with the nursing facility to ensure proper implementation. Dr. Pellegrino's assessment becomes a pivotal factor, with his voicemail indicating their father can still make decisions "when it's obvious" despite his stroke. Hanh discovers notes in Kaiser records confirming their father's expressed wish for Mark to be the primary healthcare agent, and suggests Mark should take this role with her as backup. This represents a significant shift in family dynamics, moving decision-making authority from Hien to Mark, with Hanh acting as a mediator who prioritizes honoring their father's wishes over sibling politics.

            <p>A major conflict erupts over beneficiary designations and inheritance plans for their father's assets. Mark emails their mother asking to be removed as her beneficiary while explaining that their father has designated him to inherit the Chipper house, with Hien inheriting the remaining liquid assets (estimated at $200,000). This revelation provokes an explosive response from Hien, who accuses Mark of manipulating their father for personal gain, writing, "This is about your greed and manipulating dad for your own selfish gains." Mark defends his actions as being responsive to their father's wishes and insists the stroke resulted from lack of care when their father was in Northern California. The siblings engage in increasingly bitter exchanges, with Hien declaring "I no longer have a brother. I lost him to his greed," while Mark characterizes Hien as failing to fulfill his responsibilities. Meanwhile, Mark also works to designate beneficiaries for all financial accounts, requesting social security numbers from his siblings and explaining the need to avoid probate complications. This episode reveals deep fractures in sibling relationships centered on perceptions of financial motivation versus genuine caregiving concerns.</p>

            <h2>Mother's Intervention and Appeal for Family Unity</h2>
            <p>As sibling tensions reach a breaking point, Thanh (mother) intervenes with an emotional plea for unity during their father's health crisis. In response to the heated exchanges between her children, she writes a heartfelt message expressing deep sadness about the situation and emphasizing that her primary concern is their father's wellbeing. She acknowledges their father's history of poor decisions, including being "taken advantage by a lot of people, women, his relatives," but urges the siblings to set aside their differences for his sake. Thanh offers her own financial assistance if needed, writing, "I do not know how long I live, can be one day, can be 50 more years, but I am willing to help financially." She advocates for their father to receive dignified care for his remaining life, suggesting a quality assisted living facility like Stoneridge, which she describes as "a five star hotel." Hanh later reinforces this message, urging her brothers to "set aside your differences and come together to see Dad to a peaceful end." This intervention represents an attempt to refocus the family on their father's immediate needs rather than inheritance and past grievances.</p>

            <h2>Financial Planning and Asset Management</h2>
            <p>As their father recovers from his stroke, Mark takes a leading role in organizing his financial affairs. He outlines a comprehensive plan for managing the Chipper Lane property and covering care expenses, dividing expenses into three categories: house improvements (which Mark will fund personally), rental income management, and assisted living costs. Mark estimates monthly expenses at around $7,000 for board and care, partially offset by $2,000 in rental income, $2,400 from Social Security, and $1,000 from annuities, leaving approximately $1,600 monthly to be drawn from liquid assets (estimated at $500,000). Mark also addresses their father's cell phone management and the Jessica Cao loan recovery efforts, explaining he found evidence in text messages that might be relevant to the legal case. Though Mark notes he's under no obligation to provide financial transparency, he offers to share statements with his siblings, demonstrating an attempt to balance control with communication. The systematic approach to financial management contrasts with the emotional family conflicts, showing Mark's methodical handling of practical matters despite relational tensions.</p>

            <p>Mark continues to organize his father's financial affairs, completing beneficiary designations for all accounts. While most accounts now list Hanh and Hien as beneficiaries, Mark notes that some financial institutions wouldn't allow beneficiary changes through Power of Attorney, requiring him to transfer those funds to Bank of America. He also evaluates the conservative nature of his father's investments, with approximately $100,000 held in cash and fixed income despite Mark's suggestion to invest more aggressively. The financial organization extends to vehicle matters as well, with Mark planning to sell the 2005 Camry while deciding what to do with the 2022 Corolla, which has been in accidents and has a "long gash on the passenger side." Throughout this process, Mark maintains detailed records and provides transparent updates to his siblings about the asset management, though notes "I'm under no obligation to provide financial transparency."</p>

            <h2>Planning Father's Move to Northern California</h2>
            <p>By early August, Mark has initiated plans to move their father from the Sterling board and care facility in Huntington Beach to Northern California, targeting September 10th as the move date. His dissatisfaction with the current facility stems from observations about inadequate care: "He says there was physical therapy, but not daily... I don't see them fortifying drinks with protein like they said they do... The bell and call button weren't where Dad could reach them." Mark coordinates with Hanh to find a suitable location in the Fremont area, which would be equidistant between their homes, though Mark later considers San Jose locations as well. Transportation becomes a significant logistical challenge, with options including air transport or specialized medical transport services (quoted at $8,050). Working with resources provided by his employee assistance program and recommendations from healthcare social workers, Mark researches various assisted living facilities, with proximity to his workplace becoming an important consideration given his plan to visit his father "5-6 times per week." Meanwhile, Hanh uses her Southwest Airlines points to book flights for Mark and their father, arranging wheelchair assistance and scheduling the move for Labor Day weekend. Throughout the planning, Mark notes their father is recovering well, even regaining some mobility: "my mind was blown when he did this yesterday... This was a first for him, to be able to flex his 'paralyzed' right leg."</p>

            <p>The family monitors their father's medical progress following his stroke, with Mark reporting significant improvements in his condition: "Speech much easier to understand. Eating is much more normal... right leg also seeing significant improvement, with flexing now doable." During a meeting with his father's doctor, Mark discusses the planned move to Northern California, with the physician supporting the relocation to be closer to family. Mark also manages various healthcare aspects, including coordinating with Kaiser to ensure therapy benefits transfer between regions, discussing prescription adjustments (notably Metformin being discontinued due to kidney function concerns), and arranging physical therapy sessions. Physical therapist Jessica Epperson begins working with their father twice weekly, focusing on core strength and wheelchair mobility. However, Hanh expresses frustration about their father's previous healthcare neglect, stating "Dad has to do everything the hard way out of pure selfishness. If he hadn't insisted leaving the Bay Area, he wouldn't be a prisoner of his own body right now." Mark responds more diplomatically, acknowledging their father's resistance to help but suggesting it stemmed from pride rather than selfishness: "I don't think he meant to be a burden on others... He never asked us for help. To his own detriment, he relied on people like Jeff and Annalise for mutual help."</p>

Mark manages the logistics of getting their father from Sterling Senior Community to an assisted living facility in San Jose called Oakmont. Hanh coordinates the Southwest Airlines flights and shares information about wheelchair assistance and transportation needs. The flights were rebooked from September 1st to September 2nd, with meticulous attention to details like curbside assistance and wheelchair handling forms. Mark develops a comprehensive transportation plan including wheelchair-accessible Uber transportation to Long Beach airport, Southwest assistance at the airports, and transportation to Belmont Village at Santana Row in San Jose. He also coordinates with medical professionals, arranging for Dr. Susan Rose Hsu in Pleasanton to order a hospital bed for their father's new residence. The move was executed earlier than initially planned (September 2nd rather than September 10th) due to their father expressing "acute anxiety about his residence at the Columbia home." The careful planning and coordination demonstrate the siblings working effectively on practical matters despite their ongoing interpersonal tensions.</p>

The dinner is framed as an opportunity for the family to gather "as he transitions to a new chapter of a storied life."

            <p>The family addresses the complex issue of car insurance and vehicle management as their father's previous AAA insurance policy approaches its expiration date of September 19th, 2023. Mark takes lead on researching insurance options for his mother's Honda, comparing quotes from Geico ($720/year) and AAA Northern California ($1,766/year). Confusion arises when Hanh misunderstands Mark's reference to "your car," thinking he meant one of their father's vehicles should be transferred to her, prompting her clarification: "I don't need dad's car to drive." Meanwhile, their mother decides to handle her own insurance through AAA, listing herself as the sole driver for both her Honda and the Toyota Corolla, describing the latter as a "leisure car" and noting how "home and car insurance [is] a huge problem for everybody." Mark continues managing the insurance process for his mother, requesting her driver's license and car registration information, and ultimately forwarding the Geico information once processed. The emails reveal the practical challenges of managing these financial responsibilities during their father's transition to assisted living, with Mark attempting to balance efficiency with family inclusion while their mother takes some independent actions regarding the vehicles.</p>

            <p>Mark initiates a car exchange with his mother to provide her with a safer vehicle featuring more advanced safety features. He proposes that his mother keep the Toyota Corolla, which has a rear-view camera and other safety features suited for older drivers, while he takes her Honda for driving to Orange County. Mark frames this as a temporary arrangement, writing "we will trade back, after you no longer want to drive anymore." His mother responds positively, acknowledging that her husband (the children's father) had specifically purchased the Corolla for her because of these safety features, though she expresses some apprehension about learning to use a new car. Mark reassures her that the learning curve won't be steep, primarily requiring her to "get used to the feel of a new car," and arranges to drive the Corolla to her home the following weekend. Mark later informs his sister Hanh about the car exchange, explaining the safety rationale and noting the Corolla's low mileage (8,600 miles) and recent maintenance. When Hanh expresses surprise about their mother's interest in switching vehicles, Mark clarifies that their mother had been paying for the Corolla's insurance despite not driving it, and that their father had originally intended the car for her safety. This exchange demonstrates Mark's ongoing concern for his mother's wellbeing while managing family assets during their father's health crisis.</p>

            <h2>Father's Medical Visit and Condition Update</h2>
            <p>Mark takes his father to a doctor's appointment with Dr. Yap, a new primary care physician, and shares the detailed visit summary with his siblings. The report reveals his father's serious condition: weight 165 pounds (down from approximately 185), blood pressure 108/58, and abnormal lab results including high sodium (148 mmol/L) and high blood glucose (287 mg/dL). Most concerning is the physician's assessment that lists multiple health issues: dementia, type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease stage 3, atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation, and congestive heart failure. The doctor prescribes Zoloft (an antidepressant) and makes medication adjustments including increasing the dosage of glipizide (for diabetes). When Hanh inquires about reasons for the high glucose level, Mark explains their father had run out of glipizide and notes the facility gives him "a lot of starch in effort to feed him soft food." This medical update marks an important documentation of their father's declining health, with Mark taking an active role in his healthcare management despite the challenging diagnosis. The siblings maintain respectful and practical communication about their father's care needs in this exchange, setting aside previous conflicts to focus on immediate health concerns.</p>

            <h2>Mother-Daughter Tension</h2>
            <p>An emotional conflict erupts between Thanh (mother) and her daughter Hanh, revealing deeper family tensions. Thanh sends a strongly worded email to Mark expressing her distress: "I am upset so much! Hanh, Please stop giving me free advices... Any of your advice about cleaning my house keeps me awake all night, because i can not do more than what i am doing so far." Thanh asserts her independence and mental capacities, writing "As long as mine brain still functions, i know what i am doing to keep my active and independent life," and explicitly requests respect: "Please respect me as much as others." When Mark inquires whether Thanh meant to send this message to him rather than Hanh, she confirms it was intentional, suggesting she wanted Mark to be aware of her feelings without directly confronting Hanh. The exchange reveals Thanh's struggle to maintain her autonomy while feeling judged about her housekeeping, as well as her preference for living alone ("That is why i keep living by myself"). This incident highlights generational tensions between adult children and aging parents, with Thanh resisting what she perceives as unwelcome interference in her lifestyle while using Mark as a confidant or potential mediator in her relationship with Hanh.</p>

            <h2>Holiday Event Coordination</h2>
            <p>Despite ongoing family tensions, the Cao family maintains some normalcy through holiday season planning. Hanh organizes two significant gatherings: a Post-Thanksgiving Family Get Together and a Holiday Glowfari outing at the Oakland Zoo. For the post-Thanksgiving event, Hanh sends a Google Calendar invitation to multiple family members including Mark, Jackie, Grace, Jeff, Alex, and their parents. The Glowfari event involves more detailed coordination, with Hanh preparing tickets and providing specific logistics: "If you want to caravan, please meet at our place by 5p OR meet us at the zoo entrance by 5:20 to go in." Mark responds promptly to both invitations, confirming attendance and arranging to meet at Hanh's home to carpool. This coordination demonstrates the family's commitment to maintaining traditions and gathering despite their father's health situation and interpersonal conflicts. The practical nature of these exchanges — focused on dates, times, and logistics rather than emotional content — allows family members to connect in structured settings that minimize potential for conflict while preserving important family bonds through shared experiences.</p>

            <h2>End-of-Life Planning and Funeral Arrangements</h2>
            <p>The family begins addressing serious end-of-life planning matters as their father's health continues to decline. Thanh (mother) takes a proactive approach to funeral planning, visiting funeral homes to gather information about cremation options and costs. She shares detailed notes with Mark regarding pricing: "Property for 2 (2 in one flat plot) 13,410$... Total package for two about 20,000$... For Cremation for two... Total package for Two 13549$." She also investigates specific funeral homes like Jess Spencer mortuary in Castro Valley, obtaining quotes for services: "Viewing from 10:00 2:00... With viewing 3870$ for each person... Closed casket 3380$." The emails suggest Thanh is planning not only for her husband's eventual passing but also her own future arrangements, as she references "keepsake for ashes of dad and me." The practical, almost businesslike approach to these difficult topics reflects Thanh's pragmatic nature while also demonstrating her desire to reduce future burdens on her children by making these arrangements in advance. Meanwhile, her DMV license renewal success ("I passed the dmv test") indicates her continued focus on maintaining independence despite these sobering preparations.</p>

            <h2>Mother's Hawaii Trip Cancellation</h2>
            <p>Thanh (mother) makes the difficult decision to cancel her planned vacation to Hawaii due to her husband's deteriorating health. In an email to the vacation property owner named Ally, she explains: "My husband had a very bad stroke a month ago. His condition is getting worse and no hope to improved... My situation is I need time to recover myself at Maui If he passed away, but i do now know when?" The message reveals both practical considerations about the "prime time in Hawaii" reservation she must relinquish and her emotional state as she balances her own needs for recovery with her uncertain timeline as a caregiver. Thanh's candid acknowledgment that she plans to use Hawaii as a place to "recover myself" after her husband's anticipated passing reflects her realistic assessment of the situation while maintaining hope she might still realize her dream vacation at a later date: "If i can not make my dream comes true this time, will check with you again for another period." This episode demonstrates how the family's personal plans continue to be disrupted by their father's health situation, with Thanh making significant sacrifices while attempting to maintain a practical outlook on both her husband's prognosis and her own future needs.</p>

            <p>As their father's condition continues to require careful attention, the family considers practical matters for the future. Thanh (mother) drafts a formal death announcement (Cáo Phó) in Vietnamese, which she shares with her children for review. The draft contains biographical information about their father, highlighting his academic achievements ("PhD-Georgetown University"), professional positions ("Nguyen Phu Ta Tong Truong Tai Chanh VNCH... Nguyen Giaosu HocVien QuốcGia Hãnhchanh"), and religious affiliation ("Pháp danh: Quảng Thức"). The document lists family members as mourners, including his wife and three children with their families. Thanh makes multiple revisions to ensure accuracy and comprehensiveness, noting "I have changed the announcement with more information." Meanwhile, she informs her children of her travel plans, writing "I will be back on feb 22" and "You can contact with me by viber or email." Thanh also shares a deeply personal document titled "Những dieu em nho mai suot cuoc doi" (Things I will remember all my life), containing intimate reflections on her relationship with her husband. She requests that her children "khi nao thuan tien cac con thay ma doc cho ba nghe" (when convenient, please read this to your father), suggesting she wants these memories shared with him before a potential decline. These preparations reveal the family's anticipatory planning process and Thanh's desire to both honor her husband's legacy appropriately and ensure her own emotional expression is documented.</p>

            <p>While her husband remains in care, Thanh (mother) travels to Vietnam and maintains communication with her children about her experiences. In detailed emails, she describes receiving exceptional care from her Vietnamese relatives: "I have been feeding very heathy and special foods by di My such as heart of palm salads, duck, chicken, charcoal grilled shrimp... and varieties of tropical fruits." She outlines her daily activities including morning walks, evening strolls, Zumba dance exercises, and occasional shopping trips to local markets with her host.

She also mentions her plan for "a five day trip on a trans-Vietnam modern train for sight seeing with Be Nhu." Despite enjoying her trip, Thanh expresses concern about her husband's condition: "Hope that Dad is still fighting for his life until i come back," to which Mark responds reassuringly: "Dad seems a bit weaker to me, but I believe he'll survive. :-) Please enjoy your time traveling and do not worry so much about Dad." This exchange reveals the complex emotional balance Thanh maintains — taking necessary time for herself while remaining connected to her husband's situation from afar, with Mark supporting her self-care by minimizing concerns about their father's condition.</p>

            <p>Thanh travels to Washington DC, where she once lived with her then husband during his studies at Georgetown University over 50 years ago. The trip represents a significant emotional journey for her, revisiting important locations from their early marriage. Hanh coordinates with her friends Frank and Ed to show Thanh around, arranging a detailed sightseeing schedule: "he will drive you to Embassy Row in Georgetown. Lunch at a favorite French place called: Chez Billy Sud. Take a boat trip at 1:30p to the wharf, then head to the botanical gardens and come back to Georgetown." Thanh expresses tremendous satisfaction with her accommodations and schedule, enthusiastically reporting "The first time in my life, for over 50 Years, i had 8 hours of sleep last night! The room is very private and very comfortable." She also mentions the emotional significance of the visit, noting "The time i visited DC, over 50 years ago, the Grant's was over 70. The house is probably transferred to several other owners, even though they have children." Thanh explicitly connects this journey to her husband's memory, stating "It will be a pleasant surprise for Dad to show him a lot of pictures of the trip" and recalling "I still have tons of letter we wrote at the time, in my garage." This trip represents Thanh's effort to reconnect with significant places from her shared history with her husband while he remains unable to travel, with the support of her daughter's social connections facilitating this meaningful experience.</p>

            <h2>Cemetery Plot Sales Efforts</h2>
            <p>The family actively works to sell cemetery plots and funeral arrangements previously purchased for their parents. Mark researches the most cost-effective listing options, recommending TheCemeteryExchange.com for its reasonable fees: "TheCemeteryExchange.com appears to have a relatively low commission cost for selling a cemetery plot, with listing fees ranging from $71.95 to $329.95." After receiving his mother's approval, Mark creates a listing initially priced at $22,000 for both plots. However, pricing disagreements emerge when his mother requests a higher asking price: "Could you help to list with a website with the price 18,000 for one plot or 25000 for both." Mark provides detailed guidance about the cemetery arrangements, clarifying that "Both plots have to be sold at the same time" and explaining various components of the package including "2 interment rights for the 2 plots; 2 granite markers and installation; and 2 concrete outer burial containers (OBC) and installation." He also notes practical considerations like the $500 transfer fee that must be paid to Westminster Memorial Park. Beyond the cemetery plots, Mark investigates transferability of funeral arrangements with American Memorial Life Insurance, detailing the contract numbers and benefits: "Contract #: 6-489783 (Ho V Cao), Contract #: 6-489784 (Thanh X Huynh), Benefit per contract: $9,347. Cash value: $7,410." The mother also pursues alternative sales channels through Vietnamese community connections, obtaining contact information for "Thạch Hoàng" at Westminster Memorial Park, "An Nguyễn" at Ana Real Estate, and advertising options in the Vietnamese newspaper "Nhật báo Người Việt." These efforts reflect the family's practical approach to managing end-of-life arrangements while their father remains in assisted living, with both Mark and his mother actively participating in the process from their respective perspectives.</p>

(2) After August, also no remodeling (adding of walls, new tenant, etc. -- that work will be postponed to June 1, 2025). (3) However, after August, my mother will increase the rent to keep up with the market." Mark advises his mother to issue a 60-day notice for tenancy ending 8/31/2024 while informing the tenant about the new rental amount. However, after direct communication between Thanh and the tenant, a different arrangement emerges: "A new contract will be sent to Maria... From June 1 2024 to May 31 2025, Rent is 3300 for the new contract." Mark promptly drafts and signs the new rental agreement for his mother, modifying it to make rent due on the 5th of each month rather than the 1st to provide more flexibility. He also arranges for repairs, noting that tenant Maria has recommended a handyman named Felipe who "already looked at the wall problem and he can fix it." Mark contacts Felipe and schedules a meeting "around July 4th" to address the repairs. This property management sequence demonstrates the practical collaboration between Mark and his mother in managing financial assets, with Mark providing administrative support while respecting his mother's authority to make final decisions about her property. It also reveals the routine financial responsibilities the family continues to manage alongside their father's healthcare situation.</p>

        <h2>Feeding Tube Consideration</h2>
        <p>As their father's condition continues to decline, the family begins exploring more intensive care options. Hanh shares a document titled "Tube Feeding" with her mother and brother Mark, providing educational information about enteral nutrition options for their father. This formal sharing of medical information suggests the family is facing decisions about whether to implement a feeding tube as their father's ability to eat normally diminishes. The timing of this document sharing coincides with the shift toward end-of-life care medications noted in the previous communications, indicating the family is weighing multiple aspects of palliative versus interventional care. While no immediate decision or discussion is documented in the subsequent emails, this exchange represents an important moment in the family's ongoing navigation of their father's medical care, with Hanh taking initiative to ensure family members have access to relevant information for potential upcoming care decisions.</p>

        <h2>Understanding Father's Medical Condition</h2>
        <p>Mark takes initiative to research and explain his father's complicated medical condition to his mother. Responding to concerns about persistently high sodium levels in his father's bloodwork, Mark provides a detailed explanation: "In a diabetic patient, chronically high sodium levels, also known as hypernatremia, can be caused by several factors. One of the main reasons is the body's response to high blood sugar levels, which leads to excessive urination and dehydration." He further elaborates on additional contributing factors including kidney disorders and insulin resistance, and even provides a Vietnamese translation of his explanation, demonstrating sensitivity to his mother's potential language preferences. This educational exchange reveals Mark's ongoing commitment to understanding his father's complex medical situation and helping his mother comprehend the physiological processes affecting her husband. His mother responds appreciatively, connecting this medical information to practical care decisions: "Observing dad coming back from the hospital, i decide that i wont agree with Dr Chan, to let him enjoy anything he likes because he is dying!" She emphasizes that what her husband needs most is family presence rather than food indulgences, writing "All he needs at the time being is family. Frequent visitation really bring joy and happiness to him." This exchange highlights the family's effort to make informed care decisions while balancing medical understanding with quality-of-life considerations for their father's final stage.</p>

        <p>As their father's condition becomes increasingly terminal, the family begins concrete preparations for his eventual funeral. Mark creates a comprehensive analysis of his father's current prescription changes, noting the medical team has transitioned from maintenance medications to comfort care, concluding this represents "a significant shift in the patient's treatment plan... [suggesting] the patient may be transitioning to end-of-life or palliative care." He shares this analysis with both his mother and sister Hanh, ensuring all family members understand the medical reality of their father's situation. By early July, more explicit funeral planning begins, with emails referencing a "Plan for grandpa funeral" and discussions about a "Family name list for the master of ceremony" for the funeral service. This progression from medical analysis to practical funeral arrangements demonstrates the family's pragmatic approach to their father's imminent passing, working collaboratively to prepare for end-of-life rituals while maintaining his comfort and dignity during his final days. The systematic way they share information and divide responsibilities reflects their commitment to honoring their father appropriately despite the emotional difficulty of accepting his terminal condition.</p>

        <h2>Care Facility Transition Dispute</h2>
        <p>A significant conflict develops in late 2024 regarding their father's living situation. Mark visits a potential new assisted living facility in Castro Valley at his mother's request but ultimately decides against moving his father, writing: "I do not see any advantages for him of this new home; and I see some disadvantages." This prompts an emotional plea from Thanh, who argues that proximity would allow her to visit more frequently, explaining she's "exhausted and fear[s] of danger in driving and sleeplessness" at age 81. Mark remains firm in his decision, suggesting alternative solutions like his mother selling her home to move closer or using Uber for transportation. In a subsequent email, Mark reveals more concerning details, claiming his mother misrepresented a facility owner as "a student" visiting his father and had deposited $4,500 to this facility owner without proper authority. He also references an incident where his mother allegedly attempted to remove their father from his current facility without proper authorization. This situation represents a significant escalation in the family's disagreements about their father's care, with Mark exercising his POA authority despite his mother's emotional appeals.</p>

        <h2>Medical Conferences and Consent Issues</h2>
        <p>The family participates in formal medical care conferences to discuss their father's ongoing care needs. A hospice social worker named Deyanira Lopez arranges a meeting, which triggers some coordination challenges when Hanh notes she's out of the country until November 22. Despite this, a conference is scheduled for November 14, with family members negotiating remote participation options. Later in November, Mark sends a formal "Lack of consent" message to his mother, addressing her as "Ms. Huynh" and citing her statement that he is "no longer your son." The message explicitly withdraws consent for her recording family members, including their father, in private settings, claiming her "intention for audio and video recordings is not for his welfare or benefit" but rather is "selective and biased, and are disruptive to the care workers." This period demonstrates the escalation of family conflict into formal boundaries and consent issues, while healthcare professionals attempt to facilitate collaborative decision-making about their father's ongoing care.</p>

        <p>In December 2024, the family navigates both holiday socializing and practical matters while tensions continue. Hanh attempts to arrange for their father to attend a holiday party at "Man and Carolyn's home," which Mark resists, citing concerns about the legitimacy of transporting him. He expresses suspicion about his mother's intentions and warns that attempting to move his father without authorization could result in "serious legal trouble." Simultaneously, the family manages a car accident involving their mother's Honda, with Hanh handling insurance claims through Geico. The emails reveal that the Honda lacked collision coverage, with Mark acknowledging responsibility for this oversight and offering to pay the replacement cost if necessary.

        <p>Tensions dramatically escalate in January 2025 regarding their father's care at Kingdom Hearts Care Home. On January 6th, Mark forwards a message about "Redwood, B&C and your role" that sets boundaries for family members' involvement in their father's care. By January 9th, the situation deteriorates further when Mark sends a formal letter titled "Concerns Regarding Dad's Care and Well-being" to his mother and sister, addressing what he considers problematic behaviors: his mother misrepresenting herself as his father's wife, his sister claiming to have POA authority, bringing expired food, and giving their father "false hope" about recovery. This prompts heated exchanges where Hanh accuses Mark of wanting their father to die for financial gain, which Mark vehemently denies. The conflict intensifies with Mark producing screenshots of past text messages where he claims Hanh had encouraged end-of-life care for their father two years earlier, directly contradicting her current position.</p>

        <h2>Car Transfer and Insurance Issues</h2>
        <p>The year begins with Mark coordinating the transfer of a Toyota Corolla to his mother. In a January 3rd email, he details leaving documents in "a manila folder on Dad's bed shelf" containing the car registration, 2025 sticker, title transfer documents (including REG 256 Statement of Facts), and a business license fee statement. He recommends how to complete the transfer "as a gift, with a tax advantage" and mentions removing the Corolla and Accord from his Geico policy since his mother has been added to Hanh's insurance. When his mother attempts to process the title transfer at AAA, they reject it due to a date change on the title, requiring additional paperwork (REG 252). This leads to several weeks of back-and-forth communications about DMV forms, with Jeff (Hanh's husband) helping coordinate, illustrating how even routine matters require complex family coordination during this difficult time.</p>

        <h2>Family Conflict Intensifies Over Care Decisions</h2>
        <p>Significant family conflicts erupt regarding care approaches and family dynamics. Multiple concerning email subjects appear, including "Concerns Regarding Dad's Care and Well-being," a message about "Greed," and most alarmingly, messages referencing past care discussions and "Permission revoked for Jacqulyn Huynh and Hanh Yu." These communications suggest severe disagreements have developed regarding their father's care, possible motivations, and decision-making authority. The accusatory nature of these subject lines indicates a breakdown in the previously collaborative approach to their father's care, with serious allegations being made between family members. Another email titled "Your disrespect for Dad and me" suggests Mark feels personally aggrieved by certain family members' actions. These intensifying conflicts reveal how care situations can strain even previously functional family relationships, as stress, different perspectives on appropriate care, and potentially unresolved past tensions converge during an emotionally charged time.</p>

        <p>During February 2025, the family deals with insurance matters related to a December 2024 car accident involving their mother's Honda. Mark handles the Geico claim, noting the lack of collision coverage on the vehicle—an oversight he acknowledges responsibility for—and offers to pay the replacement cost of $8,800. This leads to complex back-and-forth communications with Geico and within the family when the other party involved in the accident hires a lawyer and seeks injury compensation. Mark forwards Geico correspondence to his mother, explaining they need permission to disclose the $50,000 insurance liability limit to the other party's lawyer. His mother expresses concerns about potentially fraudulent claims, asking if they need a lawyer, but Mark advises letting Geico handle the matter. Their conversation reveals ongoing tensions, with Mark suggesting his mother be "less judgmental" of people in accident claims situations, while trying to maintain a practical focus on resolving the insurance matter.</p>

Emails discuss "AI car accident investigation" and follow up on "GEICO claim Letter" matters, suggesting ongoing insurance claims processing related to the family vehicle accident. A subject line mentioning "Check of 8000$" indicates significant financial transactions continue during this emotionally challenging time. Most notably, a message concerning "dad@probably.needs more lucerna for supplement" reveals continued attention to their father's basic nutritional needs despite the surrounding family discord, suggesting that practical caregiving continues regardless of relationship tensions. These parallel practical communications amid emotional conflict demonstrate how families must manage both the interpersonal and logistical dimensions of care situations simultaneously. The continued attention to their father's nutritional needs particularly highlights how immediate care concerns persist and require attention regardless of broader family disagreements, with someone (likely Mark based on established patterns) ensuring their father's basic needs are met despite the deteriorating family dynamics.</p>
