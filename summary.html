            <p>Mark (Huy) meets Annalise (80-81), his father's new companion in Huntington Beach. She claims his father rescued her from an abusive senior home. Mark initially finds her to be a "math genius" and caring about his father's health. The household includes problematic tenants, notably "bipolar" Ken. Mark communicates regularly with Annalise, providing health resources. His father displays concerning behaviors including pettiness toward Annalise, financial dishonesty, and resistance to health assistance. Mark notes Annalise is discovering his father's "quirks and doesn't like it," though considers her "a nice lady, although sometimes confused."

            <h2>Hearing Aid Discussion</h2>
            <p>The siblings discuss getting their father a hearing aid after news that over-the-counter hearing aids are now available without prescription. Hanh suggests this as a Christmas gift, noting hearing loss can contribute to cognitive decline. Hien is concerned about whether their father would actually use it due to vanity issues. All agree to contribute to the cost, with Huy (Mark) offering to research and gather information from Annalise. This conversation reveals the siblings' ongoing concern about their father's health and their efforts to help despite his resistance.</p>

            <h2>Father's Health Concerns and Hospital Visit</h2>
            <p>Annalise informs Mark that paramedics took his father to Fountain Valley Hospital. Mark relates confusing details to siblings: "probably by paramedic. In another message, she was saying they tried to take a cab, but the cab people were rude to them and said they could just go to a shelter and be euthanized." The issue involves knee problems, with his father claiming "he is now okay." Mark suspects Annalise's account may be affected by mental health issues, noting "I think that might have been her schizo acting up." Hanh expresses concern about diabetes management affecting mobility, but Mark responds pessimistically: "Remember Duong 3 was going blind and wouldn't stop eating sweets. You can't help people with lifestyle choices." Hien suggests giving their father money instead of a hearing aid, noting "From the things that Huy is relaying, dad needs money."</p>

Mark advises calling police for tenant issues and notes the house lacks proper heating, which "is not legal." By December, tenant Ken is allegedly stealing food on Christmas Day, suggesting an increasingly unstable and unsafe living environment with their father unable to manage his rental property or behavior.</p>

            <p>Tensions emerge between siblings regarding parental care. Mark privately tells Hanh he's surprised by "how impatient" Hien is with their parents, stating "Aging problems are hard to deal with, for sure. But in the end, we just have to deal with them as they are." Hanh advocates for patience and kindness, reflecting on how they'd want their own children to treat them when aging. Group conversations reveal strategic disagreements about phone assistance, with Hien expressing frustration: "I don't know why he doesn't do that to begin with when he screws up his phone. It's not like I can fix it remotely." These exchanges reveal different philosophies about balancing parental autonomy with necessary intervention.</p>

Their father initially refused hospital transport but later drove her to Fountain Valley Hospital for X-rays of "ribs and shoulders."

Hien confirms their father's hospital location via Find My app. Annalise has no memory of the incident, suggesting their father "would not harm me" but adds "But he might [have] dementia."

            <p>Modified Summary:** Family struggles to coordinate father's Christmas travel from Southern California to Bay Area due to communication difficulties. Their father has "Do Not Disturb" activated on his iPhone, blocking calls. Hien notes "I can't tell if he's doing it on purpose" and later discovers he lost his phone and bought a new one without informing his children. His Southwest flight is canceled December 24th. Siblings question his ability to travel independently, with Mark asking if "it's a great idea for him to try a trip, if he has had trouble walking." These issues highlight growing concerns about their father's cognitive decline and inability to manage basic tasks.</p>

            <p>January 2023 messages reveal concerning financial management patterns. Annalise reported when father recovered lost money, he immediately "put it into the lottery." Mark noted father seemed under financial pressure, possibly struggling with mortgage payments, leading to demands for money from Annalise. Father carried large cash amounts ($1,000) in public, borrowed from Annalise during financial difficulties, yet continued spending on luxuries like "$30/lb lobster." Their mother revealed previous exploitation: "own family, Bac 8 (older brother or sister?) swindled him out of $20K." These financial red flags contributed significantly to family determination that intervention was necessary.</p>

Hanh acknowledges they "need a plan in place to protect Dad from himself" and suggests legal counsel, noting "The biggest challenge right now is getting Dad to point where he acknowledges that he needs help."

            <h2>Rising Tensions Between Siblings During Intervention</h2>
            <p>Mid-January 2023 messages reveal emerging tensions as siblings coordinated father's care. Initial cooperation gave way to disagreements about approach and information credibility. Mark defended Annalise when Hien dismissed her as a "questionable source" with "known mental issues," stating "She has memory lapses and can't drive. She doesn't make things up for fun." The exchange escalated with Mark accusing Hien of not understanding mental illness and of using an opportunity when on speakerphone to "call Mom stupid." Mark told Hien to "STFU," before Hanh suggested they "take a breather." Despite these tensions, they continued coordinating father's medical appointments and Bay Area transition, foreshadowing more serious rifts over inheritance and caregiving that developed later.</p>

            <h2>Eviction Process and Dad's Return to Huntington Beach</h2>
            <p>The family continues managing the eviction of Ken from their father's Huntington Beach property. Mark provides updates about the legal process, noting that while Ken didn't respond to the court filing within the allowed timeframe, the courts might still allow a delayed response. Mark explains that even with a default judgment, it could take until late March for the sheriff to physically remove the tenant. On February 12, their father announces his plan to return permanently to Huntington Beach after a February 18 trip with Mark. He intends to negotiate directly with Ken for February and March rent payments and a March end-date for tenancy. This decision surprises his children, who had been working to bring him to the Bay Area permanently due to health concerns. The situation highlights tensions between their father's desire for independence and his children's concern for his wellbeing.
Dad attempted to leave Hanh's home with his luggage, with Hanh and Hien suggesting he be "5150'd" while Mark argued for respecting Dad's autonomy. 
Multiple incidents involve Dad standing on Hanh's driveway with packed luggage. Hanh refuses to call an Uber, implementing a tough-love approach supported by Hien and their mother, who declares he'd be "on his own" if he leaves. Family debates involving Adult Protective Services or having him "5150'd" (involuntarily committed). Mark opposes forced intervention, arguing Dad would be "happier returning to Huntington Beach and dying sooner but autonomously." On February 18, Dad successfully escapes to San Jose, securing transportation to the Xedohoang bus terminal and returning to Huntington Beach, as confirmed by phone GPS tracking. This incident crystallizes the siblings' philosophical divide between autonomy (Mark) and protection (Hien and Hanh) in managing Dad's care.
Dad ultimately returned to Huntington Beach on February 18, highlighting the family's disagreements over appropriate interventions.</p>

            <h2>Managing Dad's Legal Appointments Remotely</h2>
            <p>Hanh intervenes to help manage their father's legal appointments related to a lawsuit, demonstrating the increasing family management of his affairs. When their father insists on traveling to Los Angeles for meetings with attorney Karina Padua at The Law Offices of Jacob Emrani, Hanh contacts the law firm directly. She explains their father's serious health issues and requests remote meeting options. The attorney confirms they can conduct both the consultation and medical evaluation via Zoom, alleviating the immediate pressure for travel. This episode demonstrates how the siblings are taking more assertive roles in managing their father's affairs after his dementia diagnosis, particularly in situations where travel or complex decision-making is involved.</p>

            <h2>Tenant Issues and Eviction Court Case</h2>
            <p>The family deals with increasingly complex tenant problems at their father's Huntington Beach property. Ken Van Natta, a tenant whom the family had been trying to evict, sends concerning messages to Mark about their father's mental state and problematic situations with Annalise. Ken reports that their father is showing signs of Alzheimer's, with good and bad days, and that Annalise has returned to the house despite earlier allegations against her. Ken describes serious safety concerns including Annalise leaving burners on at night and poor household cleanliness. The siblings discuss this situation, with Hien noting their father's erratic behavior, including making multiple urgent phone calls about trivial matters like a T-Mobile account. Mark attempts to dismiss both the eviction case against Ken and a restraining order their father had filed, but their father later cancels these legal remedies, showing his inconsistent decision-making. The situation reflects the challenging intersection of their father's declining cognitive capacity and his insistence on managing rental properties independently.</p>

            <h2>Huntington Beach Trip Report and Care Planning</h2>
            <p>Mark provides a detailed report after visiting their father's home in Huntington Beach from March 11-14. His observations confirm serious concerns about their father's living situation and mental capacity. The house is in poor condition with excessive clutter, bio odors, and unhygienic conditions. Mark notes he was able to end both the eviction case against Ken and their father's restraining order request, temporarily reducing legal entanglements. However, he describes a complex, dysfunctional dynamic between their father, Annalise, and tenants Ken and Jeff. During the visit, Mark learns that their father's driver's license appears to be suspended, though their father still drives and has been in car accidents. Mark also meets with Chu Y (a family advisor), who strongly recommends consulting with an Elder Care Financial Planner and warns about potential severe consequences if their father is caught driving without a license, including property seizure to fund state-mandated care. The report reveals that Mark attempted to initiate a 60-day eviction notice for tenants, but their father quickly canceled it, showing his inconsistent decision-making and resistance to help despite his declining capacity to manage his affairs.</p>

            <h2>Mark's Visit to Huntington Beach and Complex Tenant Dynamics</h2>
            <p>Mark's March 2023 Huntington Beach visit reveals deteriorating conditions as he assists Dad with eviction proceedings. He discovers Dad driving Annalise's car despite license suspension, living in disorganized conditions, and resuming unhealthy habits including soda consumption. After extended interaction with tenant Ken Van Natta, including a 45-minute call, Mark concludes Ken is "also nuts, but in a different way than Annalise and Dad," suspecting Annalise as the primary manipulator. Ken reports disturbing incidents—Dad "physically spit in his face" and tenant Jeff allegedly "choked" Ken. Mark's investigation reveals Annalise's credit score of 567, undermining her claim of losing $12,000, and warns Hanh that "something very bad is going to happen either to Annalise or because of Annalise." The visit confirms Mark's assessment of the property as a "clown house" and documents Dad's regression since returning to this environment.</p>

            <h2>Handling Tenant Demands and Legal Threats</h2>
            <p>Mark manages complex negotiations with Ken, the tenant at their father's Huntington Beach property. Ken attempts to use his medical condition as leverage to delay eviction and extract financial concessions. Mark shares his email to Ken requesting documentation of medical needs and questioning Ken's demand for $5,000 to vacate the property, characterizing this as potentially extortionary. Mark explains to his siblings that Ken is employing a strategy frequently used in California, positioning himself as a disabled person requiring accommodation, which complicates the eviction process due to legal protections for vulnerable tenants. This situation highlights the challenges the family faces in managing their father's property affairs while dealing with difficult tenants who understand how to navigate tenant protection laws. It also demonstrates the increasing legal and financial complexities arising from their father's diminished capacity to manage his rental business effectively.</p>

            <h2>Adult Protective Services Involvement Plan</h2>
            <p>The family develops a strategy to involve Adult Protective Services (APS) to address their father's declining situation. Mark drafts a comprehensive report of concerns to present to APS, including their father driving without a valid license after having been in accidents, making unsubstantiated allegations against tenants, engaging in harassment, maintaining unsafe and unsanitary living conditions, and failing to take prescribed medications. The family discusses how to frame these concerns to APS effectively, with Thanh (their mother) advising them to present information objectively rather than accusatorily, emphasizing concern for their father's wellbeing while letting social workers investigate the details. Hanh adds documentation about their father's February memory assessment and formal dementia diagnosis, including the doctor's written recommendations against driving and for accepting help with healthcare and financial decisions. This coordination shows the family reaching a critical decision point about external intervention after months of attempting to manage their father's decline more privately, recognizing the increasing safety risks and their limited ability to help from a distance.</p>

            <p>Mark initiates contact with Adult Protective Services (APS) regarding their father's situation. After speaking with APS social worker Liz, Mark shares her feedback that while the case is concerning, APS has limited power to mandate interventions without their father's cooperation. Liz suggests calling the DMV to report driving concerns and contacting the "Office of the Public Guardian OC" for help with conservatorship. Mark emphasizes to his siblings that they need to present a strong case to APS to prompt meaningful action, noting that APS workers typically seek the "least restrictive means" of resolving issues and will only escalate interventions if they perceive significant risk. The family debates strategy, with some members preferring a less confrontational approach while Mark advocates for presenting detailed concerns to ensure APS fully recognizes the severity of the situation. These exchanges reveal the family's struggle to navigate bureaucratic systems designed to protect autonomy while addressing genuine safety concerns for their father and those around him.</p>

Mark proposes not actively excluding Annalise to make their father more amenable to conservatorship.

            <h2>Meeting with APS Social Worker Michelle Nguyen</h2>
            <p>The family initiates more formal engagement with Adult Protective Services through social worker Michelle Nguyen. After Mark's initial contact, Michelle reaches out to coordinate a conference call with all siblings to discuss their father's situation. The emails show the family preparing for this important meeting by gathering documentation and aligning on their approach. Mark suggests they clearly communicate their intention to pursue conservatorship, hoping Michelle can provide guidance based on her professional experience. During this period, Michelle also shares that she has had previous interactions with their father, who had attempted to portray himself as financially secure while refusing to allow her inside his home. This revelation confirms external validation of their concerns about their father's living conditions and decision-making. The coordination of this meeting represents a significant escalation in formal intervention efforts and demonstrates the family's increasingly structured approach to addressing their father's declining situation.</p>

            <h2>Dad's Driving Incident and Police Intervention</h2>
            <p>Mark encounters a critical situation while visiting the Huntington Beach area in April 2023. He follows his father, who is driving despite his suspended license, and observes concerning behavior including freeway driving between 40-65 mph, napping in the car, and disoriented navigation. After witnessing his father driving in a parking lot, Mark calls 911 to report a dangerous unlicensed driver. Santa Ana police officers respond and interact with both Mark and his father. While the officers believe Mark's report about the invalid license, they don't observe immediately dangerous driving behavior at that moment and are exceptionally lenient with their father. They advise Mark to pursue emergency conservatorship and include police records in the application. During the encounter, Mark maintains a cover story about coincidentally being in the area, which their father appears to believe. The officers express exasperation about frequent calls to their father's residence (at least weekly), noting the house has drawn attention from the police department, city council, fire department, and code enforcement. This incident provides concrete evidence of their father's continued unsafe driving despite medical directives and license suspension, adding urgency to the family's intervention efforts.</p>

            <h2>Deteriorating Living Conditions at Dad's Home</h2>
            <p>Mark provides disturbing details about the conditions in their father's Huntington Beach home after a brief visit. He describes a severely unhygienic environment with fruit flies hovering over trash, unmopped floors, excessive clutter blocking walkways, and a pervasive "bio odor" that gets worse with each visit. Mark reports being unable to stay in the house for more than 10 minutes due to the smell, which social worker Michelle suspected might have a feces component. Even more concerning, this odor was also present in their father's car and transferred to Mark when he drove it. The family discusses these observations, with Hanh expressing surprise that tenants would remain in such conditions and Thanh noting that the documented poor conditions actually strengthen their case for intervention. This evidence of severe household neglect provides concrete support for the family's concerns about their father's inability to maintain safe living conditions, reinforcing the need for formal intervention.</p>

            <h2>Conservatorship Attorney Research and Strategy</h2>
            <p>Following their conference call with APS social worker Michelle Nguyen, the siblings begin researching elder law attorneys who could assist with a conservatorship filing. Michelle provides a list of recommended attorneys from 2013, and Hanh conducts detailed research on potential legal representation, creating a spreadsheet comparing options based on reviews and locations. Mark and Hanh independently research attorneys, focusing on finding someone with elder law expertise who uses ethical billing practices, expecting costs between $3,000-$10,000. They identify several promising candidates including Michael Weinstein, Leslie Daff, and the Mortensen-Reinheimer group. When contacting Michael Weinstein, they learn he no longer handles conservatorships but receive a referral to another attorney who estimates a starting cost of $3,000 (compared to the typical $5,000 deposit). The family also discusses potential financial resources for legal consultation through their employers' legal service plans, with Hanh noting that her work plan offers elder law consultation. This methodical approach to securing legal representation demonstrates the family's commitment to pursuing formal intervention through proper legal channels.</p>

            <h2>Intervention Plan Development</h2>
            <p>Mark proposes informing Dad that Michelle (APS) has serious concerns and is pursuing public guardianship that would result in loss of both financial and individual freedom. Mark's plan offers Dad two options: public guardianship or voluntarily activating the Living Will to give Hanh Power of Attorney. While anticipating resistance, Mark believes Dad may reconsider when faced with public guardian involvement. The strategy involves initially placating Dad and securing agreement, with plans to be more direct after declaration of incapacitance. Mark also considers incorporating Annalise to gain Dad's cooperation.</p>

            <h2>Confrontation with Annalise and Implementing Intervention Plan</h2>
            <p>Mark visits Huntington Beach to implement the intervention plan with their father. During this visit, he has direct interactions with Annalise, confirming many of the family's concerns. Mark describes her as having poor cognitive skills but high emotional intelligence, allowing her to manipulate their father despite their strained relationship. He notes their father is acutely aware of Annalise's substantial Social Security check, suggesting financial motivation in the relationship. The visit includes breakfast with both their father and Annalise, during which Mark presents information about a potential public guardianship. Later, Mark witnesses a police encounter at the house, where officers express exasperation about frequent calls to the residence (at least weekly), which has drawn attention from the police department, city council, fire department, and code enforcement. The officers advise Mark to pursue emergency conservatorship and include police records as supporting evidence. This visit represents the family's most direct intervention attempt, confronting both their father and the chaotic household dynamics that have developed as his cognitive abilities have declined.</p>
<p>Mark attempts to secure Power of Attorney during his late April Huntington Beach visit. Dad's first words are "I am not feeling well," appearing visibly deteriorated. Mark employs a strategic approach, presenting Dad with two options: public guardianship or signing Power of Attorney to Hanh. Dad initially asks his children to "protect him from the bad Michelle" (APS worker) but remains non-committal, stating he would sign only after seeing "a detailed plan" and wanting to "consult with an attorney."</p>

            <h2>Escalating Situation with Annalise and Continued Intervention Efforts</h2>
            <p>The family's concerns about their father's relationship with Annalise intensify in early May. In a series of detailed emails, Mark describes meeting with his father and Annalise for breakfast, where he presented information about the potential involvement of a public guardian. He observes that Annalise has poor comprehension but responds to almost everything with irrelevant anecdotes about her own life. Mark notes that his father seems primarily interested in Annalise's substantial Social Security income ($3,500+ monthly) despite their strained relationship and frequent annoyance with each other. Hanh expresses her belief that their father's judgment is being blinded by financial greed related to Annalise, while also lamenting that he seems unconcerned about his health. The siblings debate whether continued intervention is worthwhile if their father refuses help, with Mark outlining three possible scenarios: allowing their father to continue making his own poor decisions, having a public guardian take over (which would drain resources quickly), or pursuing family conservatorship (which would preserve resources but face resistance). This exchange reflects the family's growing frustration and ethical dilemma about how far to push intervention when faced with persistent resistance.</p>

            <h2>Power of Attorney Strategy and Public Guardian Involvement</h2>
            <p>Mark develops a strategy to secure Power of Attorney (POA) from their father as an alternative to public guardianship. He proposes presenting their father with both Durable POA and Limited POA options, with a preference for the more comprehensive Durable POA. Hanh expresses support for this approach and suggests Mark should be the designated agent due to his ongoing involvement with their father's case. Mark notes that their father seems more trusting of Hanh for this role, possibly due to suspicion that Mark is behind his recent problems. The siblings discuss timing and approach for presenting these options, with Kim (Deputy Public Guardian) providing important background information. When meeting with their father, Kim left an informational fact sheet about public guardianship which apparently caused their father significant anxiety. The siblings strategize using this anxiety constructively to encourage their father to accept family help rather than state intervention.

            <h2>Weekend Strategy and Father's Resistance</h2>
            <p>Mark provides detailed updates about his interactions with their father and Annalise, revealing new complexities in the situation. During dinner with both of them, Mark confronts Annalise about her calling the police on their father, which she denies despite evidence to the contrary. When reminded about a specific May 1st incident, their father becomes angry at Annalise and tells her to move out, though his anger quickly subsides. Mark also helps their father with eviction paperwork against tenant Ken and observes that Annalise and their father have a strange, financially motivated relationship with mutual annoyance. Further complicating matters, Mark learns that Annalise had been telling their father the public guardian was a free volunteer service, directly contradicting the information Mark was providing. Mark plans a weekend strategy focusing on rebuilding their father's fear of the public guardian as leverage while also managing the immediate concerns of tenant eviction. This reveals the complex web of misinformation and conflicting influences surrounding their father, with Annalise actively working against the family's intervention efforts.</p>

            <p>Mark successfully obtains their father's agreement to sign a Durable Power of Attorney at the Huntington Beach library after strategic planning. Despite initial resistance, Mark creates a supportive environment leading to his father's consent. The siblings coordinate carefully, with Hanh providing backup support by phone. After signing, they visit a UPS store for notarization. Mark emphasizes psychological tactics to prevent later revocation, noting: "while it is technically revocable, our father would need to remain angry long enough to work with a lawyer to revoke it—something his fluctuating mental state makes less likely." This milestone represents months of careful planning and adaptation to their father's psychological needs.</p>

            <h2>Trust Revisions and Will Changes</h2>
            <p>Mark informs his siblings about significant changes to their father's estate planning documents, marking a major shift in family financial dynamics. The changes include making Mark the first successor trustee (replacing Hanh), potentially removing their mother as an inheritor, and their father's wish to leave the Huntington Beach property to Mark alone, possibly through pre-death transfer. Mark explains that their father initially wanted to gift the property soon to avoid liquidation by the public guardian, though Mark assured him this was unnecessary given the successful POA arrangement. Nevertheless, their father insisted on making these changes, citing Mark's extensive efforts to improve the house and address his physical needs. This announcement triggers a strong negative reaction from Hien, who accuses Mark of working toward this outcome all along for personal financial gain, while Mark defends his actions as being focused on their father's care rather than inheritance. This exchange reveals significant tensions and mistrust among the siblings regarding financial motivations in their caregiving roles.</p>

            <p>The siblings discuss various aspects of their father's estate planning, particularly focusing on avoiding probate after his death. Mark initiates conversations about keeping assets out of probate to prevent potential recovery by Medicare/Medi-Cal and other creditors. He explains that jointly-owned assets would not be protected by the trust and suggests specific beneficiary designations for accounts. The siblings also discuss the implications of probate, with Mark noting that any assets requiring probate would likely face claims from creditors with higher priority. Family friend Cuoi Cao provides advice regarding potential gift tax implications if their father were to transfer property before death, warning about negative consequences regarding tax basis and property tax reassessment. These exchanges demonstrate the family's attempt to navigate complex financial and legal considerations while planning for their father's estate, balancing current care needs with future inheritance concerns.</p>

            <h2>Jessica Cao Loan Recovery Efforts</h2>
            <p>Mark addresses their father's ongoing concerns about recovering $60,000 allegedly loaned to Jessica Cao, a niece, which was never repaid. Mark finds documentation indicating the transaction date and bank account but not the amount, along with a note stating the transaction was intended as a gift. Despite recommending their father write off the loan, Mark initiates legal proceedings to honor his father's wishes, noting Jessica's husband had recently died. Mark proposes making Hanh and Hien beneficiaries of any recovered funds, anticipating a December trial date, but both siblings express disinterest in being involved. Hanh explicitly asks to be removed from the legal action, while Hien states his only concern is ensuring their father has sufficient resources for his care needs. This situation illustrates both their father's continued financial concerns despite his cognitive decline and the siblings' differing approaches to managing his affairs, with Mark taking the most active role in pursuing their father's wishes even when other siblings are reluctant to become involved.</p>

Ken has been evicted, while Jeff is in the process of court eviction. Mark identifies two major remaining problems: their father's continued driving despite causing a minor accident, and the complicated situation with Annalise, whom their father remains undecided about removing from his life despite ongoing issues. Mark expresses hope that he can convince Annalise to move out by August and have a new rental lease starting by September, which would allow for assisted living help for their father and potentially end his dependence on driving.

In an alarming development, Mark reports that during a brief moment when he left the table to pay a restaurant bill, Annalise immediately asked their father about the financial implications of marriage, inquiring specifically about "how that affects my security." Mark describes their father as lonely, suggesting this is why he maintains the relationship despite its problems. When Hanh offers to visit their father, Mark encourages this, noting their father needs more regular family contact. However, the situation grows more complicated when Mark shares that Annalise is "out-foxing" their father, and later, that she's trying to marry him which would "really complicate things." Mark provides troubling background information that Annalise has used different names in the past and has made inconsistent statements about her marital history. This period shows the relationship with Annalise evolving from problematic roommate to potential financial predator, increasing the urgency of family intervention.</p>

            <p>A significant conflict emerges among the siblings regarding beneficiary designations and inheritance expectations. Mark asks Hanh and Hien to clarify whether they are willing to serve as trustees and beneficiaries for their father's estate, revealing that Hanh had previously texted him expressing a preference that both she and Hien be removed as beneficiaries. Hanh confirms this request, stating she prefers Mark be the beneficiary since he's doing all the work to care for their father. Hien initially responds with anger, accusing Mark of manipulating the situation for financial gain, writing "This is what you wanted all along" and suggesting Mark will eventually go after their mother's assets too. Mark responds defensively, emphasizing that he cannot make these decisions for financial motivations given their mother has more assets than their father. Mark later informs his siblings that he has told their father about Hanh's decision to be removed as beneficiary, noting their father's feelings did not seem hurt, and that in the event of their father's death before paperwork changes are finalized, Hanh should transfer any inherited assets to Hien. This exchange reveals deep tensions and mistrust among the siblings regarding financial matters and perceptions of caretaking motivations.</p>

            <h2>Settlement for 2019 Accident</h2>
            <p>Mark shares information about a significant legal settlement their father has received from a 2019 accident. Their father signs a "Release of All Claims" document for a $250,000 gross settlement, though the final amount will be substantially reduced by a 45% lawyer's fee, court costs, and medical expenses. Mark recommends their father choose a structured settlement (annuity) rather than a lump sum and notes that their father plans to designate Hien as the sole beneficiary to avoid probate complications. In follow-up communication, Mark shares new information from the lawyer Karina that medical expenses amount to approximately $165,000, much higher than anticipated, resulting in a net payment to their father of only about $60,000. This leads Hanh to question why medical expenses are so high when their father is covered by Kaiser, with Mark suggesting it might be "an attorney scheme that legit doctors don't participate in." The timing of the settlement distribution remains uncertain, with estimates ranging from two to three and a half months for final payment, creating potential concerns about what would happen if their father were to die before disbursement. This settlement provides their father with some additional resources while highlighting the complexity and potential exploitation in the personal injury legal system.</p>

            <p>The family faces a medical crisis when their father suffers a stroke, leading to hospitalization and dramatically changing his condition. CT scans reveal a blood clot, resulting in significant physical and cognitive impairments. Mark reports that their father now has very poor verbal communication skills, much weaker control of the right side of his body, incontinence issues, apparent discomfort, signs of depression, and diminished cognitive abilities. Medical staff, including a PT and occupational therapist, evaluate him to develop a rehabilitation plan, with the case manager exploring options for transfer to a skilled nursing facility. Hanh expresses concern about the impact of stroke on their father's already compromised cognitive function, noting CT scan results showing "extensive hypoattenuation in the periventricular white matter" which suggests increased likelihood of progression from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. The siblings coordinate closely with medical staff regarding transfer options, with particular concern about the challenges of outpatient rehabilitation given their father's lack of support in Orange County. This medical crisis introduces a new, more urgent dimension to the ongoing family caregiving challenges.</p>

Mark focuses on completing beneficiary designations, particularly assigning Hien as beneficiary for most assets, and notes he is avoiding revising the Living Trust during their father's illness out of respect for his previously expressed intentions. Mark also addresses healthcare directives, reminding Hien of his responsibility as the primary healthcare agent, emphasizing that decisions should align with their father's wishes and values. Additionally, Mark provides updates on legal actions their father had initiated, including the case against Jessica Cao and potential action against family member Vui.

            <h2>Rehabilitation Placement and Family Visitation</h2>
            <p>The family coordinates care for their father as he transitions from hospital to a skilled nursing facility for stroke rehabilitation. Mark shares that their father has been transferred to The Pavilion at Sunny Hills in Fullerton for what is expected to be approximately one month of rehabilitation before potentially transitioning to San Jose. He encourages Hanh and Hien to visit, suggesting it would lift their father's spirits. Hanh agrees to visit for several days, likely Sunday through Tuesday, and inquires about costs, to which Mark responds that Kaiser appears to be covering most expenses aside from a $200 ambulance transfer fee. The medical social worker also provides contact information for a San Jose placement specialist, "Creating New Hope," indicating preparations for their father's eventual relocation. This period demonstrates the siblings' continued coordination of their father's care while navigating the healthcare system and planning for his longer-term living arrangements following this significant medical event.</p>

            <h2>Family Conflict During Hospital Visit</h2>
            <p>A significant family conflict erupts during a hospital visit to their father. Mark sends a late-night email expressing frustration with Hanh's behavior during their joint visit. He reports that Dr. Pellegrino informed him that their father's average life expectancy, given his condition, is approximately one remaining year. Mark claims he conveyed this information carefully to Hanh, but alleges she then bluntly told their father "the doctor says you have a year left," which Mark found extremely offensive. The situation further deteriorated when, according to Mark, Hanh promised their father she would visit him every remaining day of his life even if he stayed in Orange County, a commitment Mark finds unrealistic, especially if their father lives beyond the average expectancy. Mark expresses concern about Hanh's promise creating expectations their father will remember despite his condition, and suggests Hanh and Hien need to formalize in writing that Hanh will transfer inherited assets to Hien, doubting she would honor such a transfer after years of daily visits. Mark states he won't initiate changes to paperwork while their father is weak but characterizes the situation as "a train wreck waiting to happen" between his siblings. This confrontational exchange reveals deep tensions about care responsibilities, inheritance, and communication styles during their father's health crisis.</p>

            <h2>Family Dynamics Throughout Father's Decline</h2>
            <p>The first half of 2023 reveals increasingly complex and sometimes strained family dynamics as the siblings navigate their father's cognitive decline and living situation. Initially, the siblings collaborate on managing their father's healthcare, with Hien creating password spreadsheets, Hanh coordinating medical appointments, and Mark addressing property issues. However, as intervention becomes more urgent due to their father's unsafe living conditions and tenant problems, roles become more distinct. Mark takes on the most active, hands-on role, making frequent visits to Huntington Beach, directly confronting problematic tenants, and eventually securing Power of Attorney. Communication styles differ significantly among siblings, with Mark preferring direct intervention while Hanh and Hien often favor more cautious approaches. Tensions emerge around financial matters, particularly after their father expresses a desire to leave his Huntington Beach property solely to Mark, leading to accusations about motives. Their father's stroke in July 2023 accelerates these dynamics, creating new urgency around care decisions while exacerbating existing conflicts about inheritance and care responsibilities. Throughout this period, their mother Thanh occasionally provides advice from her perspective as their father's former spouse, offering strategic guidance while maintaining some emotional distance from the situation. These evolving dynamics demonstrate how the stress of elder care can both strengthen family collaboration and expose underlying tensions.</p>

            <h2>Intensifying Family Conflict Over Dad's Healthcare</h2>
            <p>Following their father's stroke, serious conflicts erupt among the siblings regarding healthcare decisions. Mark communicates with medical social worker Monique Brito, expressing concern about Hien being the health-care agent, as their father allegedly told Mark he wanted this changed. The emails reveal escalating tensions between Mark and Hien, with Hien accusing Mark of manipulating their father for the Huntington Beach house and Mark claiming Hien has been completely unresponsive during their father's illness. Their exchanges become increasingly hostile, with Hien stating "There are consequences to your greed and the resulting actions," while Mark characterizes Hien's behavior as "sloth" and declares "You're out." The conflict centers on responsibility for their father's deteriorating health, with Hien asserting that Mark manipulated their father to return to Huntington Beach despite doctors' warnings about stroke risk, while Mark maintains Hien is failing in his duties as health agent.</p>
<p>When Mark emails about removing himself as their mother's beneficiary while explaining these changes, Hien accuses him of manipulation for financial gain. Hien suggests the stroke resulted from poor care after Dad's return to Orange County. Exchanges grow bitter, with Hien declaring: "I no longer have a brother. I lost him to his greed," while Mark characterizes Hien as failing his responsibilities as health agent. Their mother intervenes with an emotional plea for unity, acknowledging their father's history of poor decisions while offering financial assistance if needed. Hanh attempts mediation, urging her brothers to "set aside your differences and come together to see Dad to a peaceful end.</p>

            <p>The family begins coordinating post-stroke care arrangements for their father. Mark communicates with Denise Powell from Quality Senior Placement to explore board and care (B&C) facilities in Orange County. Denise provides detailed information about various options, including Ivy Cottages, OC Care Home, Matsonia, and Mary's Loving Care, with prices ranging from $4,000 to $6,500 monthly. The siblings discuss Kaiser's coverage for medical equipment (hospital bed, wheelchair, commode) and transportation arrangements. Social worker Sein Jeong helps coordinate the discharge from Kaiser to a skilled nursing facility, while the family evaluates various board and care options, ultimately selecting Sterling Senior Community in Huntington Beach. The process reveals the siblings working together on the practical aspects of care planning despite their interpersonal conflicts. Hanh takes a particularly active role in coordinating with healthcare providers, ensuring their father's medical records are properly transferred, and confirming his care preferences are documented.</p>

            <h2>Revised Healthcare Directive and Medical Decision-Making</h2>
            <p>Following their father's stroke, the siblings address the critical issue of healthcare decision-making authority. Mark drafts a new Advanced Healthcare Directive to replace Hien as the primary healthcare agent, in line with their father's alleged wishes. Mark shares the document with Hanh, who reviews it and suggests he coordinate with the nursing facility to ensure proper implementation. Dr. Pellegrino's assessment becomes a pivotal factor, with his voicemail indicating their father can still make decisions "when it's obvious" despite his stroke. Hanh discovers notes in Kaiser records confirming their father's expressed wish for Mark to be the primary healthcare agent, and suggests Mark should take this role with her as backup. This represents a significant shift in family dynamics, moving decision-making authority from Hien to Mark, with Hanh acting as a mediator who prioritizes honoring their father's wishes over sibling politics. The medical records and documentation become important evidence in legitimizing this transition of authority.</p>

            <h2>Inheritance Dispute and Beneficiary Changes</h2>
            <p>A major conflict erupts over beneficiary designations and inheritance plans for their father's assets. Mark emails their mother asking to be removed as her beneficiary while explaining that their father has designated him to inherit the Chipper house, with Hien inheriting the remaining liquid assets (estimated at $200,000). This revelation provokes an explosive response from Hien, who accuses Mark of manipulating their father for personal gain, writing, "This is about your greed and manipulating dad for your own selfish gains." Mark defends his actions as being responsive to their father's wishes and insists the stroke resulted from lack of care when their father was in Northern California. The siblings engage in increasingly bitter exchanges, with Hien declaring "I no longer have a brother. I lost him to his greed," while Mark characterizes Hien as failing to fulfill his responsibilities. Meanwhile, Mark also works to designate beneficiaries for all financial accounts, requesting social security numbers from his siblings and explaining the need to avoid probate complications. This episode reveals deep fractures in sibling relationships centered on perceptions of financial motivation versus genuine caregiving concerns.</p>

In response to the heated exchanges between her children, she writes a heartfelt message expressing deep sadness about the situation and emphasizing that her primary concern is their father's wellbeing. She acknowledges their father's history of poor decisions, including being "taken advantage by a lot of people, women, his relatives," but urges the siblings to set aside their differences for his sake. Thanh offers her own financial assistance if needed, writing, "I do not know how long I live, can be one day, can be 50 more years, but I am willing to help financially." She advocates for their father to receive dignified care for his remaining life, suggesting a quality assisted living facility like Stoneridge, which she describes as "a five star hotel." Hanh later reinforces this message, urging her brothers to "set aside your differences and come together to see Dad to a peaceful end." This intervention represents an attempt to refocus the family on their father's immediate needs rather than inheritance and past grievances.</p>

            <h2>Financial Planning and Asset Management</h2>
            <p>As their father recovers from his stroke, Mark accelerates the organizing his financial affairs. He outlines a comprehensive plan for managing the Chipper Lane property and covering care expenses, dividing expenses into three categories: house improvements (which Mark will fund personally), rental income management, and assisted living costs. Mark estimates monthly expenses at around $7,000 for board and care, partially offset by $2,000 in rental income, $2,400 from Social Security, and $1,000 from annuities, leaving approximately $1,600 monthly to be drawn from liquid assets (estimated at $500,000). Mark also addresses their father's cell phone management and the Jessica Cao loan recovery efforts, explaining he found evidence in text messages that might be relevant to the legal case. Though Mark notes he's under no obligation to provide financial transparency, he offers to share statements with his siblings, demonstrating an attempt to balance control with communication. The systematic approach to financial management contrasts with the emotional family conflicts, showing Mark's methodical handling of practical matters despite relational tensions.</p>

Eating is much more normal... right leg also seeing significant improvement, with flexing now doable." Their father's physician supports relocation to Northern California to be closer to family. Mark coordinates Kaiser therapy benefits between regions, visits multiple potential care facilities prioritizing private rooms and overnight staff, and documents tours with photographs. When their father transfers to Sterling Senior Community, the siblings coordinate visitation schedules and medical equipment needs. Their father becomes increasingly communicative about basic needs, clearly stating "I want to go to the restroom" while developing strategies to manage embarrassment about his limited physical capabilities. The family addresses his frustration with staff, concerns about privacy and dignity, and proper nutrition within healthcare team restrictions.</p>

            <h2>Financial Management and Beneficiary Designations</h2>
            <p>Mark continues to organize his father's financial affairs, completing beneficiary designations for all accounts. While most accounts now list Hanh and Hien as beneficiaries, Mark notes that some financial institutions wouldn't allow beneficiary changes through Power of Attorney, requiring him to transfer those funds to Bank of America. He also evaluates the conservative nature of his father's investments, with approximately $100,000 held in cash and fixed income despite Mark's suggestion to invest more aggressively. The financial organization extends to vehicle matters as well, with Mark planning to sell the 2005 Camry while deciding what to do with the 2022 Corolla, which has been in accidents and has a "long gash on the passenger side." Throughout this process, Mark maintains detailed records and provides transparent updates to his siblings about the asset management, though notes "I'm under no obligation to provide financial transparency."</p>

            <h2>Planning Father's Move to Northern California</h2>
            <p>By early August, Mark has initiated plans to move their father from the Sterling board and care facility in Huntington Beach to Northern California, targeting September 10th as the move date. His dissatisfaction with the current facility stems from observations about inadequate care: "He says there was physical therapy, but not daily... I don't see them fortifying drinks with protein like they said they do... The bell and call button weren't where Dad could reach them." Mark coordinates with Hanh to find a suitable location in the Fremont area, which would be equidistant between their homes, though Mark later considers San Jose locations as well. Transportation becomes a significant logistical challenge, with options including air transport or specialized medical transport services (quoted at $8,050). Working with resources provided by his employee assistance program and recommendations from healthcare social workers, Mark researches various assisted living facilities, with proximity to his workplace becoming an important consideration given his plan to visit his father "5-6 times per week." Meanwhile, Hanh uses her Southwest Airlines points to book flights for Mark and their father, arranging wheelchair assistance and scheduling the move for Labor Day weekend. Throughout the planning, Mark notes their father is recovering well, even regaining some mobility: "my mind was blown when he did this yesterday... This was a first for him, to be able to flex his 'paralyzed' right leg."</p>

            <p>Following Father's stroke, Mark documented daily recovery progress, noting improvements in speech, eating, and mobility: "Speech much easier to understand. Eating is much more normal... right leg also seeing significant improvement, with flexing now doable" and "right arm twitch a couple of times. Also a first." Mark identified facility deficiencies at Sterling, including "no call button. There's a bell, but they don't put it by the bed," which he called "passive-aggressive abusive." Mark researched alternative therapies including "photobiomodulation (including with a Vielight headset), sublingual EGCG, sublingual resveratrol." A physical therapist friend recommended TENS units, leading Mark to order specialized "SaeboStim devices." Hanh pushed facility staff to maintain Father's mobility despite his complaints of his "bottom being sore."</p>

            <h2>Inappropriate Behavior and Care Facility Challenges</h2>
            <p>Father exhibited concerning behaviors at care facilities. Hanh witnessed inappropriate sexual conduct, reporting "he reached up with his left leg to touch Erly" inappropriately. Hanh stated "the sad truth is Dad is a dirty old man. He shouldn't expect any sexual services or inappropriate massages from Erly." Mark acknowledged this behavior while contextualizing it: "It's pervy but it's not uncommon." Father's emotional state fluctuated dramatically, with paranoid thinking: "He thinks the two caregivers are trying to poison him, yet he wants me to tip them." At Oakmont, Father repeatedly told Mark "I am 'trying to kill him'" and declared "This place is like a prison to me!" after just one day. Mark and Hanh disagreed on interpreting these behaviors—Mark attributing them to dementia and Hanh viewing them as manipulative: "I suspect that at this point, there will never be a happy place for Dad. His condition is serious. He's miserable on top of his restless personality."</p>

            <p>Mark and Hanh transferred Father from Huntington Beach to San Jose, with Mark managing logistics. Father showed acute distress before the move, crying with relief when told his flight was moved up. Transportation logistics proved complicated, particularly wheelchair accessibility. Mark reported the flight attendant "really took charge" and "yelled at people for not allowing Dad to sit in the front row which is required for a lift." Wheelchair-accessible transportation to/from airports was challenging, with Mark discovering "Uber WAV seems like a marketing ploy" with no actual vehicles available, requiring higher-cost alternatives ($125 vs. advertised $40).</p>

If you feel that's too challenging for your family, it's better to not show up rather than show up and have a poor attitude." Five family members attended, deliberately excluding Hien.

The speech therapist reported Father was "doing really well on the swallowing & speech front." The physical therapists identified equipment issues with Father's wheelchair arm trough being "not comfortable" and "too high and can strain his shoulder," recommending a sling to prevent subluxation as "with his arm hanging down, the weight can slowly stretch the muscles away from the shoulder." Equipment acquisition involved complex coordination between Kaiser Pleasanton and family members. Progress was minimal, with Mark acknowledging "Father's not improving 🤧 Definitely plateauing," and the PT noting "It is hard to improve without carry over.

            <h2>Toyota Corolla Exchange</h2>
            <p>Mark initiates a car exchange with his mother to provide her with a safer vehicle featuring more advanced safety features. He proposes that his mother keep the Toyota Corolla, which has a rear-view camera and other safety features suited for older drivers, while he takes her Honda for driving to Orange County. Mark frames this as a temporary arrangement, writing "we will trade back, after you no longer want to drive anymore." His mother responds positively, acknowledging that Ho had specifically purchased the Corolla for her because of these safety features, though she expresses some apprehension about learning to use a new car. Mark reassures her that the learning curve won't be steep, primarily requiring her to "get used to the feel of a new car," and arranges to drive the Corolla to her home the following weekend. Mark later informs his sister Hanh about the car exchange, explaining the safety rationale and noting the Corolla's low mileage (8,600 miles) and recent maintenance. When Hanh expresses surprise about their mother's interest in switching vehicles, Mark clarifies that their mother had been paying for the Corolla's insurance despite not driving it, and that their father had originally intended the car for her safety. This exchange demonstrates Mark's ongoing concern for his mother's wellbeing while managing family assets during their father's health crisis.</p>

            <h2>Father's Medical Visit and Condition Update</h2>
            <p>Mark takes his father to a doctor's appointment with Dr. Yap, a new primary care physician. Most concerning is the physician's assessment that lists multiple health issues: dementia, type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease stage 3, atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation, and congestive heart failure. The doctor prescribes Zoloft (an antidepressant) and makes medication adjustments including increasing the dosage of glipizide (for diabetes). When Hanh inquires about reasons for the high glucose level, Mark explains their father had run out of glipizide and notes the facility gives him "a lot of starch in effort to feed him soft food." This medical update marks an important documentation of their father's declining health, with Mark taking an active role in his healthcare management despite the challenging diagnosis. The siblings maintain respectful and practical communication about their father's care needs in this exchange, setting aside previous conflicts to focus on immediate health concerns.</p>

            <h2>Mother-Daughter Tension</h2>
            <p>An emotional conflict erupts between Thanh (mother) and her daughter Hanh, revealing deeper family tensions. Thanh sends a strongly worded email to Mark expressing her distress: "I am upset so much! Hanh, Please stop giving me free advices... Any of your advice about cleaning my house keeps me awake all night, because i can not do more than what i am doing so far." Thanh asserts her independence and mental capacities, writing "As long as mine brain still functions, i know what i am doing to keep my active and independent life," and explicitly requests respect: "Please respect me as much as others." When Mark inquires whether Thanh meant to send this message to him rather than Hanh, she confirms it was intentional, suggesting she wanted Mark to be aware of her feelings without directly confronting Hanh. The exchange reveals Thanh's struggle to maintain her autonomy while feeling judged about her housekeeping, as well as her preference for living alone ("That is why i keep living by myself"). This incident highlights generational tensions between adult children and aging parents, with Thanh resisting what she perceives as unwelcome interference in her lifestyle while using Mark as a confidant or potential mediator in her relationship with Hanh.</p>

            <h2>End-of-Life Planning and Funeral Arrangements</h2>
            <p>The family begins addressing serious end-of-life planning matters as their father's health continues to decline. Thanh (mother) takes a proactive approach to funeral planning, visiting funeral homes to gather information about cremation options and costs. She shares detailed notes with Mark regarding pricing: "Property for 2 (2 in one flat plot) 13,410$... Total package for two about 20,000$... For Cremation for two... Total package for Two 13549$." She also investigates specific funeral homes like Jess Spencer mortuary in Castro Valley, obtaining quotes for services: "Viewing from 10:00 2:00... With viewing 3870$ for each person... Closed casket 3380$." The emails suggest Thanh is planning not only for her former husband's eventual passing but also her own future arrangements, as she references "keepsake for ashes of dad and me." The practical, almost businesslike approach to these difficult topics reflects Thanh's pragmatic nature while also demonstrating her desire to reduce future burdens on her children by making these arrangements in advance. Meanwhile, her DMV license renewal success ("I passed the dmv test") indicates her continued focus on maintaining independence despite these sobering preparations.</p>

            <h2>Preparing for Father's Passing</h2>
            <p>As their father's condition continues to require careful attention, the family considers practical matters for the future. Thanh (mother) drafts a formal death announcement (Cáo Phó) in Vietnamese, which she shares with her children for review. The draft contains biographical information about their father, highlighting his academic achievements ("PhD-Georgetown University"), professional positions ("Nguyen Phu Ta Tong Truong Tai Chanh VNCH... Nguyen Giaosu HocVien QuốcGia Hãnhchanh"), and religious affiliation ("Pháp danh: Quảng Thức"). The document lists family members as mourners, including his former wife and three children with their families. Thanh makes multiple revisions to ensure accuracy and comprehensiveness, noting "I have changed the announcement with more information." Meanwhile, she informs her children of her travel plans, writing "I will be back on feb 22" and "You can contact with me by viber or email." Thanh also shares a deeply personal document titled "Những dieu em nho mai suot cuoc doi" (Things I will remember all my life), containing intimate reflections on her relationship with her husband. She requests that her children "khi nao thuan tien cac con thay ma doc cho ba nghe" (when convenient, please read this to your father), suggesting she wants these memories shared with him before a potential decline. These preparations reveal the family's anticipatory planning process and Thanh's desire to both honor her husband's legacy appropriately and ensure her own emotional expression is documented.</p>

            <h2>Mother's Vietnam Trip During Father's Illness</h2>
	    <p>Thanh planned an extended trip to Vietnam (December 26-February 21) followed by Maui (March 6-April 3). Mark reported their father's rapid mental decline, noting "The only thing he likes using is his Roku TV" to watch Buddhist monks. Their father developed delusions, telling Mark "the two Filipino workers caused his stroke." To prepare for their mother's absence, Mark brought a TV into their father's room "so he can listen to the monk on YouTube," which had a calming effect.</p>
            <p>While Ho remains in care, Thanh (mother) travels to Vietnam and maintains communication with her children about her experiences. In detailed emails, she describes receiving exceptional care from her Vietnamese relatives: "I have been feeding very heathy and special foods by di My such as heart of palm salads, duck, chicken, charcoal grilled shrimp... and varieties of tropical fruits." She outlines her daily activities including morning walks, evening strolls, Zumba dance exercises, and occasional shopping trips to local markets with her host. Thanh expresses deep appreciation for her relatives' attentiveness: "I really enjoyed the warm love and care of her family," while providing updates about their professional achievements and family situations. She also mentions her plan for "a five day trip on a trans-Vietnam modern train for sight seeing with Be Nhu." Despite enjoying her trip, Thanh expresses concern about Ho's condition: "Hope that Dad is still fighting for his life until i come back," to which Mark responds reassuringly: "Dad seems a bit weaker to me, but I believe he'll survive. :-  Please enjoy your time traveling and do not worry so much about Dad."</p>

            <h2>Mother's Washington DC Trip</h2>
            <p>Thanh travels to Washington DC, where she once lived with her then husband during his studies at Georgetown University over 50 years ago. The trip represents a significant emotional journey for her, revisiting important locations from their early marriage. Hanh coordinates with her friends Frank and Ed to show Thanh around, arranging a detailed sightseeing schedule: "he will drive you to Embassy Row in Georgetown. Lunch at a favorite French place called: Chez Billy Sud. Take a boat trip at 1:30p to the wharf, then head to the botanical gardens and come back to Georgetown." Thanh expresses tremendous satisfaction with her accommodations and schedule, enthusiastically reporting "The first time in my life, for over 50 Years, i had 8 hours of sleep last night! The room is very private and very comfortable." She also mentions the emotional significance of the visit, noting "The time i visited DC, over 50 years ago, the Grant's was over 70. The house is probably transferred to several other owners, even though they have children." Thanh explicitly connects this journey to Ho's memory, stating "It will be a pleasant surprise for Dad to show him a lot of pictures of the trip" and recalling "I still have tons of letter we wrote at the time, in my garage." This trip represents Thanh's effort to reconnect with significant places from her shared history with her then husband while he remains unable to travel, with the support of her daughter's social connections facilitating this meaningful experience.</p>

            <h2>Cemetery Plot Sales Efforts</h2>
            <p>The family actively works to sell cemetery plots and funeral arrangements previously purchased for their parents. Mark researches the most cost-effective listing options, recommending TheCemeteryExchange.com for its reasonable fees: "TheCemeteryExchange.com appears to have a relatively low commission cost for selling a cemetery plot, with listing fees ranging from $71.95 to $329.95." After receiving his mother's approval, Mark creates a listing initially priced at $22,000 for both plots. However, pricing disagreements emerge when his mother requests a higher asking price: "Could you help to list with a website with the price 18,000 for one plot or 25000 for both." Mark provides detailed guidance about the cemetery arrangements, clarifying that "Both plots have to be sold at the same time" and explaining various components of the package including "2 interment rights for the 2 plots; 2 granite markers and installation; and 2 concrete outer burial containers (OBC) and installation." He also notes practical considerations like the $500 transfer fee that must be paid to Westminster Memorial Park. Beyond the cemetery plots, Mark investigates transferability of funeral arrangements with American Memorial Life Insurance, detailing the contract numbers and benefits: "Contract #: 6-489783 (Ho V Cao), Contract #: 6-489784 (Thanh X Huynh), Benefit per contract: $9,347. Cash value: $7,410." The mother also pursues alternative sales channels through Vietnamese community connections, obtaining contact information for "Thạch Hoàng" at Westminster Memorial Park, "An Nguyễn" at Ana Real Estate, and advertising options in the Vietnamese newspaper "Nhật báo Người Việt." These efforts reflect the family's practical approach to managing end-of-life arrangements while their father remains in assisted living, with both Mark and his mother actively participating in the process from their respective perspectives.</p>

            <h2>Mother's Rental Property Management</h2>
            <p>The family addresses issues with their mother's Crosby house rental property in Garden Grove. Mark communicates with tenant Maria about maintenance issues including a leaking front door, moisture damage, and kitchen sink problems, writing: "The handyman can come today to see about fixing the front door and the moisture damage." Simultaneously, he discusses lease renewal terms with his mother, proposing: "(1) Your current $3000 would end at the end of August, with no remodeling performed. (2) After August, also no remodeling (adding of walls, new tenant, etc. -- that work will be postponed to June 1, 2025). (3) However, after August, my mother will increase the rent to keep up with the market." Mark advises his mother to issue a 60-day notice for tenancy ending 8/31/2024 while informing the tenant about the new rental amount. However, after direct communication between Thanh and the tenant, a different arrangement emerges: "A new contract will be sent to Maria... From June 1 2024 to May 31 2025, Rent is 3300 for the new contract." Mark promptly drafts and signs the new rental agreement for his mother, modifying it to make rent due on the 5th of each month rather than the 1st to provide more flexibility. He also arranges for repairs, noting that tenant Maria has recommended a handyman named Felipe who "already looked at the wall problem and he can fix it." Mark contacts Felipe and schedules a meeting "around July 4th" to address the repairs. This property management sequence demonstrates the practical collaboration between Mark and his mother in managing financial assets, with Mark providing administrative support while respecting his mother's authority to make final decisions about her property. It also reveals the routine financial responsibilities the family continues to manage alongside their father's healthcare situation.</p>

      <h2>Hospice Care Decision</h2>
      <p>After father's June 2024 hospitalization, Dr. Chan advised the family to "prepare ourselves" as their father had "no chance to improve his health." The family chose hospice care over a feeding tube, with services from Redwood Hospice beginning in late June. Text messages document periods where father could eat pureed food and Thanh's hope that "when he finishes his hospice care period, we can find a treatment for him."</p>
        <p>Mark takes initiative to research and explain his father's complicated medical condition to his mother. Responding to concerns about persistently high sodium levels in his father's bloodwork, Mark provides a detailed explanation: "In a diabetic patient, chronically high sodium levels, also known as hypernatremia, can be caused by several factors. One of the main reasons is the body's response to high blood sugar levels, which leads to excessive urination and dehydration." He further elaborates on additional contributing factors including kidney disorders and insulin resistance, and even provides a Vietnamese translation of his explanation, demonstrating sensitivity to his mother's potential language preferences. This educational exchange reveals Mark's ongoing commitment to understanding his father's complex medical situation and helping his mother comprehend the physiological processes affecting her former husband. His mother responds appreciatively, connecting this medical information to practical care decisions: "Observing dad coming back from the hospital, i decide that i wont agree with Dr Chan, to let him enjoy anything he likes because he is dying!" She emphasizes that what Ho needs most is family presence rather than food indulgences, writing "All he needs at the time being is family. Frequent visitation really bring joy and happiness to him." This exchange highlights the family's effort to make informed care decisions while balancing medical understanding with quality-of-life considerations for their father's final stage.</p>

        <h2>Ongoing Group Chat With Hospice Nurse</h2>
        <p>Following their father's placement in hospice care, the family establishes a group text with hospice nurse Maylin to monitor his condition and address concerns. Maylin provides regular updates about his vital signs, medication compliance, and pain management. Text messages show the family vigilantly watching their father's nutrition, with Thanh (mother) frequently bringing him watermelon despite Mark's concern about high sugar content for a diabetic. The messages reveal their father's health fluctuations: periods of alertness and good appetite alternating with weakness and difficulty swallowing. In November, the family discusses getting an Advance Healthcare Directive updated for comfort care. By December, Mark raises concerns about constipation risks from pain medications, while Maylin continues monitoring his glucose levels and overall comfort, emphasizing their focus on quality of life rather than extending life at all costs.</p>

        <h2>Planning for Father's Funeral</h2>
        <p>As their father's condition becomes increasingly terminal, the family begins concrete preparations for his eventual funeral. Mark creates a comprehensive analysis of his father's current prescription changes, noting the medical team has transitioned from maintenance medications to comfort care, concluding this represents "a significant shift in the patient's treatment plan... [suggesting] the patient may be transitioning to end-of-life or palliative care." He shares this analysis with both his mother and sister Hanh, ensuring all family members understand the medical reality of their father's situation. By early July, more explicit funeral planning begins, with emails referencing a "Plan for grandpa funeral" and discussions about a "Family name list for the master of ceremony" for the funeral service. This progression from medical analysis to practical funeral arrangements demonstrates the family's pragmatic approach to their father's imminent passing, working collaboratively to prepare for end-of-life rituals while maintaining his comfort and dignity during his final days. The systematic way they share information and divide responsibilities reflects their commitment to honoring their father appropriately despite the emotional difficulty of accepting his terminal condition.</p>

Thanh sends a message titled "Family name list for the master of ceremony" related to funeral preparations, and another about "Plan for grandpa funeral." In a message to her children, she explains that their father "has been in hospice for several days after three days of hospitalization" and that she has "already prepared for his last day, (cemetery, funeral home, ceremony with a Buddhist master...)." She addresses the possibility that some family members might not be able to attend the funeral due to distance, offering to have headbands for them placed on the casket instead. The family also coordinates visits for extended family members, including arranging a video call between their father and Samantha, who mentions she may visit California soon. This period shows the family's pragmatic approach to end-of-life arrangements while ensuring their father maintains connections with loved ones during his final days.</p>

        <p>Amid managing their father's declining health, the family continues handling practical financial matters, including the transfer of vehicle ownership. Mark and his mother exchange emails regarding the process for transferring ownership of the family's Corolla, with Mark providing guidance on the necessary steps and paperwork. This administrative task represents a continuation of the earlier car exchange where Mark had suggested his mother keep the safer Toyota Corolla while he took her Honda.

        <h2>Care Facility Transition Dispute</h2>
        <p>A significant conflict develops in late 2024 regarding their father's living situation. Mark visits a potential new assisted living facility in Castro Valley at his mother's request but ultimately decides against moving his father, writing: "I do not see any advantages for him of this new home; and I see some disadvantages." This prompts an emotional plea from Thanh, who argues that proximity would allow her to visit more frequently, explaining she's "exhausted and fear[s] of danger in driving and sleeplessness" at age 81. Mark remains firm in his decision, suggesting alternative solutions like his mother selling her home to move closer or using Uber for transportation. In a text exchange the next day among Thanh, Mark and Elena of Blessed Home Assisted Living, Thanh reveals she deposited $4,500 with Elena. Mark informs Elena that her taking the deposit was professionally "unethical," as Thanh lacks proper authority to initiate the relocation of Ho. In a subsequent email, Mark reveals more concerning details, claiming his mother misrepresented Elena as "a student" visiting his father at Kingdom Hearts.</p>

        <h2>Escalating Family Conflict Over Care Decisions</h2>
        <p>The latter half of 2024 sees increasingly severe conflict within the family regarding their father's care arrangements. In October, Thanh (mother) begins actively seeking alternative board and care facilities, visiting Blessing Home Assisted Living in Castro Valley and expressing desire to move their father closer to her. Mark firmly refuses, citing concerns about disrupting their father's stable care situation. By November, the dispute escalates dramatically when Thanh visits Blessing Home and plans to sign a contract to move their father, telling Mark she's "willing to pay the extra cost." Mark maintains his refusal, warning that moving their father would be detrimental to his wellbeing. The conflict reaches a breaking point in December when Thanh apparently attempts to represent herself as having power of attorney at the board and care facility, which Mark addresses in strongly worded text messages to Hanh, warning of potential legal consequences of misrepresenting authorization to move their father. These exchanges reveal the deep family division over care decisions and demonstrate how their father's declining health has strained previously functional family relationships.</p>

        <h2>Father's Medical Monitoring and Care Conferences</h2>
        <p>The family continues monitoring their father's health condition after his return to baseline following his June hospital stay. Email subjects reference "Dad's situation" and a "Care Conference Calendar Invite," suggesting formal medical meetings are being scheduled to discuss care options and decisions. Multiple responses to the Care Conference invitation indicate active family participation in these discussions. An email titled "Lack of consent" hints at potential disagreements regarding medical approaches or treatment decisions, suggesting the family may be navigating complex considerations about their father's care. These communications reflect the family's ongoing engagement with healthcare providers while working through their own perspectives about appropriate care approaches. The structured nature of a Care Conference suggests healthcare professionals are facilitating formal discussions to help the family navigate care decisions and reach consensus about their father's ongoing care needs.</p>

        <h2>Holiday Season Amid Ongoing Care</h2>
        <p>The emails reveal a dispute between siblings Mark (Huy) and Hanh regarding their father's attendance at a holiday party. Hanh advocates for their father to attend for his social well-being after prolonged confinement in a care facility, noting his improved health. Mark refuses, citing concerns about jeopardizing hospice eligibility and past incidents where their mother allegedly attempted to relocate their father inappropriately, including an unauthorized $4,500 deposit to another facility. Mark suggests family visit their father at his residence instead, and requests Hanh assume legal responsibility if their mother attempts to "detain" their father during any outing.</p>

        <h2>Family Conflict Intensifies Over Care Decisions</h2>
        <p>Significant family conflicts erupt regarding care approaches and family dynamics. Multiple concerning email subjects appear, including "Concerns Regarding Dad's Care and Well-being," a message about "Greed," and most alarmingly, messages referencing past care discussions and "Permission revoked for Jacqulyn Huynh and Hanh Yu." On January 6th, Mark forwards a message about "Redwood, B&C and your role" that sets boundaries for family members' involvement in their father's care. By January 9th, the situation deteriorates further when Mark sends a formal letter titled "Concerns Regarding Dad's Care and Well-being" to his mother and sister, addressing what he considers problematic behaviors: his mother misrepresenting herself as his father's wife, his sister claiming to have POA authority, bringing expired food, and giving their father "false hope" about recovery. This prompts heated exchanges where Hanh accuses Mark of wanting their father to die for financial gain, which Mark vehemently denies. The conflict intensifies with Mark producing screenshots of past text messages where he claims Hanh had encouraged end-of-life care for their father two years earlier, directly contradicting her current position. Another email titled "Your disrespect for Dad and me" suggests Mark feels personally aggrieved by certain family members' actions.</p>

        <p>Father's dental health became another conflict source in early 2025. Mark arranged temporary repairs and appointments for new dentures. Thanh insisted "the old dentures work a lot better" despite being cracked, citing her dental technology education and claiming their father "choked a lot with the new ones." By February, she reported he "keeps complaining about pain in his Gum and keeps taking it out," demonstrating how routine health issues became proxies for deeper conflicts over decision-making authority.</p>
