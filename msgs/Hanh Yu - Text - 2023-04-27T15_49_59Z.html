<q>Weinstein doesn&#39;t do conservatorships anymore. He referred a lawyer nextdoor who called me this am. She seems do know what she&#39;s doing. Starting cost: $3K deposit. (most are $5K). She thinks his case is straight forward of the 3 of us are in agreement  to sell his house and move him to  Bay area. We need to set up conservatorship of person as well as estate. </q>

<q>That&#39;s why I told you we need to promise him he can still have annalise in his life. But you thought that was a bad idea. And so that&#39;s why we have to go to the conservatorship route</q>

<q>MN was right, Anaheim Family people are very nice.  I told the guy the straight facts because any RO against Ken will be confronted with his side of the story, but we can&#39;t pull a fast one.  The RO specialist there (who I don&#39;t think is even a lawyer) said that Dad&#39;s circumstances are unusual, and maybe the judge will grant the RO and maybe he/she won&#39;t.</q>

<q>According to him, the RO is usually because of abuse (e.g., from Ken).  And the elder being protected usually has to want it (e.g., protection from Annalise).</q>

<q>Well, why don&#39;t you think about this.  If you are having 2nd thoughts about pursuing conservatorship, the main decision fork is to placate Dad&#39;s odd desire to be with Annalise, or not.  I think that is a key to lowering his resistance.  Although, even in that case, he still needs to cede power, whether by way of a modified living trust or conservatorship.</q>

<cite class="sender vcard"><a class="tel" href="tel:+15103317454"><span class="fn">Hanh Yu</span></a></cite>:
<q>Since Dad is comfortable with  jerking us around and is only loyal to A, I&#39;m comfortable making him believe that he and A will stay together. As long as I&#39;m clear that you don&#39;t intend to bring A to bay area. Whatever it takes to get him to willingly give trustee and power of attorney. I say let him get scared by the public guardianship investigators. <br></q>

<q>It&#39;s pretty easy to sabotage their relationship later on. For example, Block her cell phone number</q>

<q>Yes, of course I don&#39;t intend to bring Annalise here.  However, it is tricky to break them up without making it obvious to Dad.  While trying to break them up, we go through the motions of letting Dad think Annalise will come up here with him.</q>

<q>The mental incompetence of the two of them makes them constantly dislike each other.  An example of them is going to Costco together, and getting separated.  Annalise believes Dad leaves her stranded there on purpose.</q>

<q>Let me flush out a plan, then I&#39;ll email to you an outline and get your feedback.  How about if we keep screening lawyers, but hold off on choosing one indefinitely.  Let&#39;s see how Dad reacts to APS actions first, then I&#39;ll go to him with a proposal.</q>
