<q>Huy.. I&#39;m still trying to understand the logic of bringing A. to the Bay area. We&#39;ve seen the havoc she has caused in Dad&#39;s life. Every person who has come into contact w/ her has has conflict or warned us against her. Dad can run back to S. CA any time if he has the capacity but if the house is sold, . is he planning expecting his relatives would care for him in OC?  I think we should wait for the RO to take effect. I can go meet with him this Thurs and organize his key docs as needed. </q>

<q>I think I don&#39;t really want to argue with you about this. I&#39;ve explained to you very many times, the issue is Dad&#39;s emotional stability.</q>
