<q>Jeff &amp; I visited Dad today. We spent most of the time in the dining room with him. Nice live birds to keep the residents entertained. He heartily ate his entire lunch and half of another person&#39;s grilled cheese sandwich. (Mary at his table was super social &amp; happy). Glad to see his appetite is back. I brought him a succulent plant arrangement that I made. His room is nice but of reeked of urine. I assume they come regularly to clean his bathroom and wash his clothes. The staff was super attentive. Glad you found such a nice place for him. I&#39;ll be back next weekend. It took us about 50 minutes to get there. Not too bad without traffic. <br></q>
