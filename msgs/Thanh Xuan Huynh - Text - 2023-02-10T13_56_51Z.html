<q>good morning, Mom.  So, the appointment with light therapy was mixed.  I wanted to see how Dad could be helped for his arthritis, neuropathy (numbness, tingling) and cognitive function.  But the therapist instead spent almost all the time identifying parasites and treating them.</q>

<q>She spent just one minute on each knee, for his arthritis.  Dad said his arthritis was indeed alleviated, but one minute isn&#39;t enough to draw any conclusions.</q>

<q>The more complicated factor is that Hanh and I had an argument last night.  The argument boiled down to Hanh saying that Dad gave her power of attorney, and she doesn&#39;t approve of him buying a house after he sells his house.</q>

<q>She and Hien are focused on Dad&#39;s dementia diagnosis.  From what she said, I have a feeling she won&#39;t support any treatment for Dad other than the Kaiser way.  So it&#39;s will not be worth buying an expensive machine.</q>

<q>After talking with her, I can see clearly what you said, that she is controlling.  And that is very inappropriate when Dad clearly still had his mind and and lots of room for improvement.</q>

<q>i decided it is better to buy the expensive one.  My main concern is that it might be too powerful, but I see it has a variable power setting.</q>
