<q>* in What a difference a walk makes. When I finished work at 5, Jeff thought Dad had been gone for 1 hour by himself. I did a search for his location and found him in the upper neighborhood. He had walked all the way to the little league base ban park about a quarter of a mile away. He seemed a little lost but exhilerated waited that far and was on his spirits.  spirits*.  Mom... Thanks for talking to dad. I was in the kitchen and heard your calming words. He&#39;s tired but didn&#39;t talk about the memory assessment. </q>

<q>Mom, try this at sunrise.  Sit in the sun for a couple of minutes, facing the sun.  Close your eyes.  Tilt your head about 45 degrees, so that sunlight can enter your nose.</q>
