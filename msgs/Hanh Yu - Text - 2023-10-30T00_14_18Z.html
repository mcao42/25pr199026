<q>I&#39;m going through what hopefully is one of the last boxes of Dad&#39;s papers. He seemed to owe many tens of thousands in credit debt around 2009 to 2010. Wonder what was going on at that time.</q>

<q>Owed to whom and is he still liable for these debts? </q>

<q>I think this was the reason why mom got out. She said she was nervous about the risks Dad taking with their money. </q>

<q>Yes, he resolved his debts.  I&#39;m sure he did, otherwise we would have seen that reflected on his more recent credit reports</q>

<q>Basically it was 10K here, $25K there ... to credit cards like Chase</q>

<q>Good to hear. Maybe that was around the time he filed for bankruptcy?</q>

<q>Huh, I never knew he did that.  One of his relatives said that he couldn&#39;t keep up with mortgage and imposed on them to take over the payments for one of his properties. Yup, it was right around 2010.</q>
