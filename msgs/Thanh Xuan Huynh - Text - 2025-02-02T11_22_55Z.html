<q>Your dads case is different from case of patients of new dentures  <br>Patients  of new dentures needs more than two weeks for the fragile gum to adjust to abrasion of prosthesis dentures <br><br>Dad had his free new dentures from cao minh hung dds, his nephew graduated. from Loma Linda, <br>It took dad years of suffering before he threw these useless   Dentures    away and had good ones  from another ac qualified dentist<br>Dad&#39;s problem is loose denture due to shrank gum of old age <br>Therefore<br>Denture need to be relined  until they  can no longer be done<br>Then we-need to have new ones    By at least two appointments at the dental office<br>- for taking dental impressions (mold) <br>- they will be sent to  dental laboratory to craft new dentures <br>- second appointment at dental office is very important to check occlusion ( bites)  to make sure that the denture fit snuggly to the gum ( do not giggle and loose fit  like  dads new ones, that the patient can chew properly, no choking, not biting tongue, and no interfering with speech<br>Denture is paid by public assistance because it is of basic needs for digestion, chewing and talking, but not for cosmetic<br>It is along procedure <br>I suggested to let  dad use his old dentures  or go without dentures with milk supplement and puree <br>Please notice that his old dentures was made be a good   dentist. They have  larger  and heavy base keeping it more stable in his jaws   and provide excellent occlusion and chewing function<br>Remember that i had AA degree of Dental Technology at  Orange Coat College and had sufficient knowledge of prosthetic teeth and dentures  <br>If you agree, i can talk to Dr Tu Cao to request him to redo it <br>He&#39;s should be   more ethical and more professional  for the the money he charged you</q>
