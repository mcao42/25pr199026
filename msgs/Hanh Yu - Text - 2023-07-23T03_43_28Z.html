<q>In a nutshell, he was embarrassed that he did a number one on the bed while guests were present.</q>

<q>The good news is that today, he seemed physically at his peak, since the stroke.  Maybe some of that was his adrenaline running.<br>When I came in, he was very excited and directed his anger at me.  His two visitors (from San Diego) had no idea what he was so angry about.  He was telling me that his bedding situation was my fault.  It wasn&#39;t clear what he meant, so he wrote down:<br>* My room is taken by another patient.<br>He then said verbally that he wanted the yother patient&#39;s bed (Bed #A). When I asked him why, he wrote:<br>* Each bed has its own arrangement.<br>All of this took a while due to unclear communication.  It was awkward for the visitors, and they left. After that he said what he meant more directly:<br>&quot;Bed A has a toilet.&quot;<br>We then explained to him that the toilet is shared between both beds, and that he couldn&#39;t use the toilet because he couldn&#39;t walk.  He pointed to the wheelchair.  We explained he couldn&#39;t use the toilet via wheelchair either because of his weakness.  This is when he calmed down.</q>

<q>the interpretation we came to is that he did a #1 into his liner when the visitors were present, and he was embarrassed about that. He got angry and didn&#39;t want to talk about it directly while the visitors were present.</q>
