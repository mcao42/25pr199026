<q>Dad said something to me that gave insight into how Annalise is manipulating him.  Dad said that Ken raped Annalise as if it were a fact.  I asked him how he knew it happened.  His response was basically, Ken would only dare to do it if Dad weren&#39;t in the house.  According to Dad, he was gone on Christmas Eve; while he was out of the house, Ken ambushed Annalise and attacked her.  (Dad basically convince himself that</q>

At the time, you said you doubted a rape happened.&quot;  Dad replied that he has not changed his mind.<br><br>And here&#39;s the insight into Dad&#39;s mind and ego:  He thinks the problem is that Ken is sexually attracted to his girlfriend!  Annalise and Dad convinced each other that Ken wants to be in their love triangle!</q>

<q>I say we get going with the conservatorship pronto.  (1) Michelle&#39;s list of elder attorneys is nothing special, as she keeps telling us.  I had been hoping she&#39;d whisper the name of a good attorney in our ears.  (2) Dad will have a publicly appointed lawyer, so our lawyer only needs to be better than that.</q>

<q>Conservatorship is supposed to be a very lengthy process.  I think we need to research lawyers carefully, so that we won&#39;t get stuck with a huge bill at the end.  Some &quot;cheap&quot; lawyers end up costing a whole lot because of the way they bill their time.</q>

<q>One of the good things about Dad knowing I was there, is that now, he knows that we know some of the crazy things he does.  I think he is capable of having a guilty conscience.  We can use this against his during the conservatorship, when he tries to lash out at us.</q>
