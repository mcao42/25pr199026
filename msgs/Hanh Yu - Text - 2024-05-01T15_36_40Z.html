<q>Hi Hanh.  He&#39;s been doing okay ... Mom made a dental appointment for him for a denture &quot;reline&quot; which he was happy about.  He had shingles a few weeks ago and has recovered.  For speaking at the lunch, if it&#39;s ceremonial, I think he would want to say a few words. But since he&#39;s not up to it, I&#39;ll suggest that mom says something that covers for him too.  Yes, he might get tired and need to leave earlier.</q>

<q>Oh no, shingles is very painful. Glad he&#39;s okay. We&#39;re super flexible. I&#39;m grateful he is able to attend. It&#39;s been month to month until he settled into this current place. He seems a lot happier there in this more home like setting. </q>
