<q>How was the talk with mom? Also, did you hear from Dad or about him? Jeff told me that Kaiser Irvine called at midnight Sat but didn&#39;t leave a msg. I was asleep and didn&#39;t hear phone ring. </q>

<q>Mom asked me about Dad, so I told her about the call from the police re: Annalise.  She projected her stress on me and told me I should block the police.  I asked her, Why would I want to do that?  The police aren&#39;t telling us for their own benefit, they&#39;re telling the family as a courtesy!  She said she was sick of hearing about Dad.  So, I asked her why did she ask??</q>

<q>Hmm, I didn&#39;t hear anything about Dad or Kaiser.  I was exasperated with Dad last time, so I didn&#39;t bother asking for his new phone number</q>

<q>BTW, Ken said Dad was mopping the kitchen for the first time in a year or so.  Sounds like he is on his best behavior, expecting a visit from the public guardian office</q>
