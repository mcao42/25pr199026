<q>Annalise told me what happened with the purse.  They were at the Walgreens at Brookhurst/Engineer, getting medicine for her.  There were three Vietnamese women in front of Dad &amp; Annalise.  When Dad &amp; A. got to the front, Dad had put his purse on a chair.  A. thinks the three women were working as a team.  One of them distracted her, and next thing you know, the purse was gone.</q>

<q>I think A. moving out will be a good thing for a couple of reasons.  One, liability reduction.  Two, Dad seems to be borrowing money from her when he&#39;s in a pinch.  So, it&#39;s going to put more pressure on him to sell the house if she&#39;s not around.</q>
