<q>Will compile a list tonight of his visitors.  I kind of don&#39;t think he wants you to be the gatekeeper, TBH.  Please remember that you turned on a dime right after he had a stroke.  You asked what you could do, and I replied that *moral* support would lift his spirits.  It doesn&#39;t meant taking charge of things.  In fact, he asked that I inherit all his assets (I said no) and he asked that I be primary on health decisions (I said no).</q>

<q>Overall, it&#39;s better that a well-intended person like yourself be involved.  Some disagreement makes for robust support.  But do keep in mind that your style and his does not match well at all.  One thing to be sensitive of is that he can&#39;t talk back, and he shuts down when overstimulated.  People like Mom and Annalise, in addition to being disliked by him, are extremely overbearing.  You might want to be very sensitive to the fact that he can&#39;t talk back -- which doesn&#39;t mean that he accepts having stuff shoved down his throat while he is in a helpful conditon.</q>

<q>They say they have an open-door policy, which tells me they probably have no way of screening visitors (or, that&#39;s not how they usually operate).  The way to control visitors is to only give out the address to people whom Dad would like to have visit him.  If someone slips through, believe me, he is more than capable of throwing a fit at this point.</q>

<q>Sterling said a $6500 room with private bath is available.  At first I said no, that is not needed, since he can&#39;t go to the bathroom by himself anyway.  But after he had the meltdown over &quot;another patient taking his room&quot; (his perceived ownership of a toilet), I decided the extra $500 would be gladly paid by Dad.</q>

<q>Fyi, Ms. Jeong was able to schedule Dad&#39;s discharge for Thurs, 11a. They will set up transportation using a gurney.  (&#39;~$200). Do you want to notify the B&amp;C? I&#39;m assuming you are not there. I</q>

<q>In the Dr. Pellegrino voicemail transcription that I just emailed, the doctor is referring to giving Dad permission to sign a new Advance Health Care Directive the other day (around 7/22).<br>Actually that was never signed because Dad reacted angrily to the ombudsman who coordinated the signing.  I heard there was a nurse there (Dad was fine with the nurse), but Dad was upset only with the ombudsman.  Nobody knows for sure why he was mad, but it probably had to do with the ombudsman talking a lot, if I had to guess.  The ombudsman is there to make sure Dad understands everything he&#39;s signing too, whether he understood all the checkboxes, and so on.  Dad grabbed something of the ombudsman, either the shirt or the badge.  Because of his bad reaction, the ombudsman did not go through with it.  I was then advised to hire a notary service once Dad leaves the skilled nursing facility.</q>
