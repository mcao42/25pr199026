<q>To get a full picture of Dad&#39;s debt situation, I got a credit report and saved to the shared drive. It&#39;s a long report but was far as I can tell, he only has only one loan. The mtg with First Savings. See p. 12. Pmts on time so far. <br></q>

<q>I suggest if you&#39;re amenable, Huy, that we put him in one of your rental units for the next couple of years. He can rotate visiting us. Being up here will slow his decline. Get on wait list but I think there&#39;s a cost. Move him to assisted care when he begins to need around the clock care. There&#39;s a well rated senior day care center about 10 minutes from our house. <br></q>

<q>I said he faked it with the doctor. Chris&#39; mom did the same thing with her doctor. My stance for the record - 1) dad need to sell the house 2) move to assisted living (where is TBD), this has changed due to more information from first hand observation from him staying with Hanh &amp; her assessment (refusal to eat right, take meds, etc). 3) he should not buy another house under any circumstance.

<q>Fyi, i finally got Dad to do the glucose test. After watching the YouTube video several times, I felt more confident in taking him through this. I pricked my finger along with him to make him more comfortable. The prescription didn&#39;t specify beyond doing it 2x/day (when to do it). So we did it just for a trial run (more than 3 hrs after a light lunch). Dad had plantain chips for a snack (1g of sugar per serving). His range was defintely high, 241. (below 99 is normal). We&#39;ll try again before bedtime and when he wakes up tomorrow, after fasting. <br></q>

<q>I talked with Dad. He&#39;d like to stay at our place next week since he&#39;s all set up and has access to the downstairs full bath. It&#39;s no problem. Jeff and Jackie will take good care of him. <br></q>
