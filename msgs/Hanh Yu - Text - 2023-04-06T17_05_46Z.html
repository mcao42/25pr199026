<q>One of the things to know about Dad is that, when he acts crazy, he is not always literally crazy.  But rather, it&#39;s a way to freak other people out, which sometimes helps him get his way.</q>

<q>I&#39;d put watching porn in front of our family in this category, or doing other things that are socially unacceptable.  He might be just trying to show how &quot;crazy&quot; he can be.</q>

<q>Any, Ken reports (and I believe him) that Dad grabbed his rob the other day and wouldn&#39;t let go.  This is while Ken was taking a bathroom break.  Ken says Dad is still relatively strong, so there was no way to make him let go, other than to hit him, which Ken didn&#39;t do.  Instead, Ken called the police.  The police came, but said they couldn&#39;t do anything about this whole situation.</q>

<q>I asked Ken how many times the police have been by in the last 3 months.  Ken thinks 6-7 times.</q>

<q>Ken gave me lots of info, but the other key piece of info is that Dad&#39;s dark Corolla hasn&#39;t been at home in a while.  This strongly suggests the car could have been impounded</q>

<q>I think we will need to get Mom involved, as she has more info on process than we do.  And things could start happening very fast.  Can you meet this weekend with mom and me if I come to her house?</q>
