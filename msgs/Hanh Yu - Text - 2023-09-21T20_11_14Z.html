<q>Dad has been wild the last couple of days, including demanding to go to the dining room, then sitting there sobbing.  He got the idea in his mind that massage is what will help his stroke recovery the most (this idea encouraged by Co 7&#39;s daughter).</q>

<q>I&#39;m hoping he will be on his best behavior on Saturday.  Generally the more alert he is, the more he starts to form odd ideas and be very assertive about them.</q>

<q>That&#39;s why I&#39;m concerned about so many people coming on Saturday. It gives him a platform for bad behavior. I&#39;m wary b/c he did at my place and last Sunday.  He can be both very sad &amp; manipulative. It&#39;s emotionally draining. <br></q>

<q>Well, remember that we disagree about what happened at your place.  The situation was squarely false imprisonment, and he had every right to throw a sh*tstorm when he felt he was detained.</q>

<q>I view this dinner as being for him to commemorate a big change in life, of going to assisted living.  If he can pull off being a pleasant &quot;guest of honor,&quot; all the better for him.  But failing that, at least we tried to provide a sort of commemoration for him.</q>

<q>A couple of days ago, he told me about three times that I am &quot;trying to kill him.&quot;  He looked serious when he said.  I wasn&#39;t surprised at all by his words because of how often he said so about other people.  I opened my eyes wide and said, &quot;Ohhh my goodness!!!&quot;  A few seconds later, both he and I were laughing about it.</q>

<q>Honestly, I don&#39;t need to subject my family to Dad&#39;s shanigans. Being old and sick isn&#39;t an excuse for treating people like dirt. It&#39;s a big effort to go every week to visit him. You yourself said he thinks he&#39;s in prison now. What&#39;s your role when no one would take Dad earlier this year? I&#39;ll make an early exit if he acts up. </q>

<q>I&#39;m less offended by Dad and more offended that you keep characterizing his stay at my house as imprisoning him. Remember that you said you were teaching him a lesson when you both had a fall out b/c he didn&#39;t like who you had hired to do the eviction. He took it out on Jackie and it was unacceptable. </q>

<q>Once, he said about Oakmont:  This feels like a prison.  I have asked him repeatedly if he feels that way.  He&#39;s mum.  If comes the day he says consistently it&#39;s a prison, I&#39;m going to take him out.  When the time comes that he has dementia officially, only then will I make unilateral decisions for him.</q>
