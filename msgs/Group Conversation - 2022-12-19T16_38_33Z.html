<q>I have been ignoring a few of Annalise&#39;s calls, but I need to call her today and get an update.  I have a feeling that it&#39;s not a great idea for him to try a trip, if he has had trouble walking.</q>

<q>If Hanh is picking him up, she can also ask to go to the gate and meet him when his flight arrives. Same thing on arrival, cart or wheelchair out to the curb. He has tech issues. Would be much easier to deal with if he&#39;s here<br></q>

<q>Let us know what Analisa says, Huy. I&#39;m wondering if Dad can make the trip also. I once ordered a wheelchair for Mom when she had knee issues and they are very good in providing support. It would be helpful to know of Dad is checking in anything. His trip is brief but carying luggage on board night be tough for him. He shouldn&#39;t check in electronics though. <br></q>

<q>Oops, I should not have ignored the voicemail from Annalise&#39;s phone, on 12/11. Dad was using her phone to ask me for Hien&#39;s phone number.</q>

<q>Dad said his phone was out of commission, so he was using her phone.  I guess Dad never was able to contact you, Hien?</q>

<q>Since he&#39;s not in town, his best solution to phone issues is to go to T-Mobile. I will tell him that when I see him<br></q>

<q>I don&#39;t know why he doesn&#39;t do that to begin with when he screws up his phone. It&#39;s not like I can fix it remotely. With him and mom, all they say is that my phone doesn&#39;t work without any further details. Even then, they&#39;re not much I can do from up here. It&#39;s impossible to walk him through troubleshooting steps<br></q>
