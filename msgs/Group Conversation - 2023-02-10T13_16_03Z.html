<q>I&#39;m helping dad for only two reasons. (1) To improve his health. Hien (and Hanh to a lesser extent) are opposing my approach, saying that Kaiser Permanente is the only approach that is not a waste of time. (2) I&#39;m helping dad for his dignity, because I know he still has a mind and in fact has shown rapid improvement with very basic changes.</q>

<q>Huy.  We share the same overall objectives. Looks like dad has packed his stuff into the luggages you brought. Is he planning to go to your house? Pls make sure he takes his meds regularly. The 500mg dosage was not working for him but he didn&#39;t want to take the higher dosage because it upset his stomach. He generally know how to do the sugar test. Without help, he takes about 15 minutes to do it. He doesn&#39;t know the timing after the meal and needs reminders. Regarding food, he&#39;s making healthier choices but doesn&#39;t follow portion guidelines. So you have to heat up and only put his servings in front of him. Don&#39;t do family style service because he&#39;ll keep on eating. <br></q>

<q>He is somewhat confused about dates. It sounded to me like he wasn&#39;t sure if the trip to OC is this weekend or next.  So, he is packing for OC, I believe.  Now, why is he packing so much?  I believe because he seems to have an intention of returning to HB.  This is why I keep reminding that we need to treat him as respectfully as possible.</q>

<q>Not sure what made him angry, but I suspect either the thing about stock investment.  There&#39;s also an outside chance that when I mentioned resveratrol to him this morning, he seemed to get upset (that&#39;s when he started talking again about going back to HB and dying there).  Not too many people get upset about supplements, so I have no idea.</q>
