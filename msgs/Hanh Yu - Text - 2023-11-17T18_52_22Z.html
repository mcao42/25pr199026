<q>I think he already made choices on his own terms, in the AHD.  Dad&#39;s current behavior is definitely a sign of depression, I completely agree with that.  But also he&#39;s a drama queen and attention-seeking much of the time.  Some of that is hard to sort out, which is why any decisions should be made deliberately.</q>

<q>For example:  He wants to relieve the ache of his right arm and complains about it often.  That doesn&#39;t seem consistent with someone who&#39;s dwelling on dying. A more cautious approach for his case is to try to relieve his depression.  After that, see where the chips fall</q>
