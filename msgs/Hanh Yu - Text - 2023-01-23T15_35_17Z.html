<q>Not crucial to find his ID.  Actually that might be a good reason to have him stay longer.  I probably need to go back with him to change his locks once Ken is moved out.</q>

<q>I&#39;ve already made arrangement to travel to OC this pm so will look. But yes, his return should be based on Ken&#39;s departure. Dad&#39;s showing progress. Once he goes back to OC, I worry about his regression. </q>

<q>You can have a story ready, in case you meet Ken. If he asks you who you are, tell him you are here with the owner&#39;s permission (they know him as Sam), and that &quot;You (Ken) aren&#39;t the owner.&quot; That will probably knock him off his feet and make him leave you alone. Maybe carry a folder and pen around and say you&#39;re from the County. Vague stuff, to put fear in the back of his mind.</q>

<q>Hard to tell now, but remember that Dad was secretive in the past.  His mortgage statements should really be all online.  Worse comes to worst, just call the mortgage company with him sitting beside you.  That could be a lot easier than trying to find his mortgage statements at Chipper</q>

<q>Bad news. The eviction could take as long as 2 months due to waiting for court processing. I will email out to you the details</q>

<q>Just talked to Dad. he got edgy with me about Annalise. I think he didn&#39;t understand (1) she&#39;s cognitively very impaired, very high maintenance.  and (2) she&#39;s a user. I told him flat out, none of us will help her if she were living in San Jose</q>
