<q>Please bring the two blue bottles, the NAD+. I&#39;m going to give Dad a different supplement that absorbs better, NMN. If he&#39;s not using this, then please also bring the resveratrol, the white bottle</q>

<q>I&#39;ll set a reminder to ask Dad. Tonight was rough. I took him for some xrays of his knees this afternoon. Had to drive from one Kaiser to another to find an one. He said he had an upset stomach.  When we got home, he exploded diarrhea all over the downstairs bathroom. Took hours to clean up. Lesson learned, he shouldn&#39;t be away from home more than 1 hr and make sure he wears his depends. Now understand what you mean by incontinence. Somehow I thought it was constipation! </q>
