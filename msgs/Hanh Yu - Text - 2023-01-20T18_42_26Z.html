<q>BTW, I do realize my views about science are unconventional.  In that sense I am part of the problem.  But it&#39;s not possible to suppress scientific truth at the moment, because it affects both of our parents.</q>

<q>And, again, it&#39;s not political for me, it&#39;s physiology.  I have nothing to say about the harm to the vaccines for you, your children, etc. because you have a certain political view.  But those views, in my opinion, are harmful toward MY parents.</q>

<q>You very seriously need to get yourself real facts about, say, diabetes, before the Standard of Care harms Dad or Mom.  The people who study the literature, a substantial portion of them go with the low-carb approach, not the high-dose approach.</q>

<q>In your lifetime, the public health authorities will never correct themselves.  Proof of this is that 100 years ago, treating diabetes was done with a low-carb diet.  It was only in 2019 that the American Diabetes Assoc put low carb as a treatment approach back in their guidelines; and, at that, only with caveats.</q>

<q>Two years ago, Trey kicked me out of his house for saying that the vaccines had a high rate of severe side effects.  He called me a conspiracy theorist for saying that ivermectin is an effective drug for COVID.  He also questioned me more recently for saying that aging pathways have been discovered.  In every case, he later apologized and said I was right.</q>

<q>He said he wanted to apologize to me about the COVID opinions.  BUT I told him the truth, that he changed his mind only because he was no longer in a clinic environment in which he would have still had social pressure on him to maintain the Standard of Care opinion.  He can&#39;t accept that he is just a weak human being.</q>
