<q>Dad&#39;s new restraining order case was dismissed. He was a no-show</q>

<q>Regarding your text message re: MN.  IMO, Dad was at his nicest when he was doing the Buddhist meditations.</q>

<q>Currently, he is very confused.  He is being led astray badly by Annalise.  She was telling me yesterday that him selling the house is a bad idea, since all his profits will be wiped out by taxes.  She said he should keep the property, with her being his manager, because she can get things done competently.</q>

<q>Michelle told me a couple of times she thought Dad&#39;s situation is &quot;very difficult,&quot; by which she probably meant that he doesn&#39;t accept help.  it&#39;s not that hard to sell her on Dad having a mental difficulties (beyond dementia).  I believe the two best things she can do for us are (1) steer us toward how to start a conservatorship, and (2) be a witness for the court proceedings.</q>

<q>BTW, looks like Duong 8 is making a name for himself.  At his 37th marriage anniversary, he had naked sushi.  At a death anniversary of his parent, he had belly dancers performing.</q>

<q>Re the GPS, I don&#39;t know who would be willing to do that.  Ken is most likely.  It needs to be done competently.  Otherwise if the police keep getting called, they&#39;ll tend to ignore the requests.</q>
