<q>Good luck, Huy. You are doing the right thing for Dad. There isn&#39;t much of a difference b/t the original plan and the care we&#39;re bringing as trusted agents. The major difference is now we have a clearer picture of dad&#39;s situation and what he needs. <br></q>

<q>This is my thoughts<br>Huy, you are very sincere <br>You might not understand all my thoughts<br>I do no know if i want to tell you the strategy of a social service insider <br>When di Tam was on welfare i tried to find ways <br>to  avoid job search for welfare recipient, because  i know that college education will help her in the long term<br>Her welfare worker was Terrie, my close friend, did not know that she has di Tam&#39;s case , until she made a home call to determine job search exemption for her (to take care if di chin who was suicidal)<br>If  you file for protective supervision right away with some knowledge that you search  by yourself  ,  the worker will investigate  to see if there is any skim or bad intention behind the filing (50%) not saying that some worker had prejudice about children financially abused parents. The more we trie to convince him the more he suspect. The more we get angry the more we irritate him<br>As i know, people who has mental problems has good  days that he seems  normal)and bad days  <br>Dad is very smart to do it <br>If the social worker finds the facts himself and  go through deeper in dad&#39;s multiple problems he believe more and more in his facts findings. He then go to family for more info<br>That is when we act<br>Nowadays there are more and more crime and social problems and shortage of social workers to deal with it<br>They will find way to handle the shortage of employees and do not want to keep a case for a long time<br> Social services will try to use social network to compensate the shortage of human resources<br>That is when they contact with you and ask you what we want to do at the now  <br>Besides thw senior social worker will refer dad for menal heal treatment...<br>Please read carefully<br>I trie hard but i di not know that i express all my thoughts<br>What i want is &quot;to play with the system&quot;. But it is not the right term<br></q>
