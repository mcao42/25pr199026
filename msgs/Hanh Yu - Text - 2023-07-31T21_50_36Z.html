<q>Spoke with Dr. Pellegrino this morning.  He became more cautious about the statement of the stroke being a brain stem type.  He said the brain stem and corona radiata are connected, and therefore if one of them is the site of a stroke,  the other is affected too.  He said he is not a neurologist, but his statement was based on speaking with the neurogogist and observation of Dad&#39;s symptoms.<br>I asked him if the symptoms of a brain stem stroke weren&#39;t more along the lines of involuntary control, e.g. heart, breathing, becoming affected.  So he said that even if the corona radiata isn&#39;t technically part of the brain stem, it&#39;s still white matter, and that the concern of recurrence is still similar.<br>Then he said he&#39;d double check his statement of recurrence and will get back to us.<br>I told him about Dad moving his right leg on Sunday quite a bit (albeit during sleep).  he said that&#39;s a good sign.<br>He said Dad should be good to go for a discharge tomorrow, although he did say that some things should be monitored, e.g., blood pressure.</q>

<q>Fyi, Sein called. She said doc said not brain stem syringe but related, per your notes. They are setting up gurney transport, the TBD. They will call you.  She ordered physical therapy for dad at house. Since we&#39;re not there, someone will go through med instructions at B&amp;C. I asked for written instructions too. Should be in Dad&#39;s Kaiser acct. </q>

<q>I&#39;m curious, why does it save time for Di 8 to help with the smog check?  Unless there&#39;s some time savings, I&#39;d rather do this sooner rather than later.  I am there every week.</q>

<q>Oh okay.  I am seeing that registration is complicated for this vehicle because it&#39;s so late.  I am going to try to push it through.  Typically the smog part is somewhat independent of the vehicle registration part (both are done electronically but separately).  I&#39;ll let you know if I don&#39;t get it done soon.</q>

<q>Yeah, they were threatening to impound the corolla when Hien renewed registration 6 mos late but they took the payment. </q>

<q>One thing I forgot to ask at the B&amp;C.  Since Dad doesn&#39;t have a phone, did Michele provide  contact info for us to see how Dad is doing or for us to talk to him once his speech gets better? I guess we can use iPad if he knows how to activate FaceTime. </q>

<q>We can always give him a phone, but I wasn&#39;t in a hurry to do that because of the people who can bother him. As for the b&amp;c, I&#39;m sure most people visit locally, so reporting is not something they usually do, but we can always ask.</q>
