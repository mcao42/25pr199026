<q>Since Mom is still coughing, Jackie &amp; I visited Dad. He seems to be in good spirits.  Was playing group bingo and doing pretty well. Attentive to the letters and numbers being called out.  Brought him crab and a tiny bit of rice to go with his lunch. He didn&#39;t eat much. He didn&#39;t like the plain pasta they gave him. He asked for a sandwich but they said it&#39;s too hard for him to chew. He asked for help installing a cup holder. You might want to bring a Phillips screw driver to tighten. </q>
